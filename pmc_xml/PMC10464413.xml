However, the role of BRCA is unclear in colorectal cancer; the results regarding the association between BRCA gene mutations and colorectal cancer risk are inconsistent and even controversial. This study aimed to investigate whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are associated with colorectal cancer risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this systematic review, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle&#8211;Ottawa Scale (NOS). Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to estimate the probability of Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility gene (BRCA1) and Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility gene (BRCA2) mutations in colorectal cancer patients.

In the past 20&#160;years, the age of onset of CRC tends to be younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CRC is characterised by higher incidence, younger onset age and genetic susceptibility, but the data on the molecular characteristics of CRC is relatively limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, in the context of precision medicine, a broader molecular tumour map should be explored to update the biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CRC patients.</p><p id="Par6">The breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene (BRCA1) and breast cancer type 2 susceptibility gene (BRCA2) were first mapped to&#160;chromosome arms 17q and 13q in the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. BRCA1 and BRCA2 as tumour suppression genes are crucial in the DNA repair process by homologous recombination, which plays an essential role in chromosome integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The additional functions of BRCA genes, such as chromatin remodelling and transcriptional control, also contributed to tumour suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers show a lifetime risk of up to approximately 85% and 20%&#8211;40% for breast and ovarian cancers, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. BRCA mutations are also known to be risk factors of pancreatic and prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a large case&#8211;control study comparing 3030 patients with pancreatic cancer with reference controls, significant associations were observed between pancreatic cancer and BRCA2 [1.9% of cases and 0.3% of controls; odds ratio (OR), 6.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.62&#8211;8.17] and BRCA1 (0.6% of cases and 0.2% of controls; OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.54&#8211;4.05) mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Studies have indicated recently that BRCA mutation was associated with the development of CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Allelic losses at the BRCA1 locus have been detected in almost 50% of sporadic CRC cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A retrospective cohort study in North America and Western Europe investigated families with ovarian or breast cancer and found the relative risk of CRC in BRCA1 mutation carriers to be 4.11 (95% CI, 2.36&#8211;7.15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another study analysed the coding regions of 27 cancer-predisposing genes in 12,503 unselected Japanese CRC patients and 23,705 controls by using target sequencing and a genome-wide SNP chip, which identified that the pathogenic variants of BRCA1 (OR, 2.6) and BRCA2 (OR, 1.9) were significantly associated with CRC development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Contrarily, a retrospective study in five countries from Canada, the United States or&#160;Europe reported that the incidence of CRC in BRCA1 (standardised incidence ratio (SIR), 0.92; 95% CI, 0.54&#8211;1.40, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.7) and BRCA2 (SIR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.30&#8211;1.81, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.7) mutation carriers was not greater as compared to that of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

This finding was more pronounced in two studies that were published earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Both studies detected only three common founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. In contrast, Akcay et al.

The primary function of BRCA2 is in homologous recombination.

Loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function in normal cells leads to growth defects that, combined with a subsequent loss of other DDR mediators, promote tumour development.</p><p id="Par26">BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected in at least 5% of unselected patients with breast cancer and in approximately 30% of patients with a positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The presence of these mutations is associated with younger age at cancer diagnosis and higher risk of cancer recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Currently, effective biomarker targeted oral medications, namely poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). PARP inhibitors exploit and exacerbate these tumour vulnerabilities by inducing DNA damage, preventing DNA repair and amassing unresolved replication intermediates that instigate replication and mitotic catastrophe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and as maintenance therapy for platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer with germline mutations in DNA repair genes BRCA1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] followed about 7000 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and showed a nearly five-fold risk for CRC in female carriers of the BRCA1 gene mutation who were below the age of 50 compared with general population. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess the association between BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and risk for young-onset CRC in this meta-analysis, since authors have different definitions of &#8216;young-onset&#8217; and set different standards, which interferes with the analysis.</p><p id="Par28">Some studies have reached different conclusions. Oh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] included 14 studies prior to 2017 for meta-analysis and concluded that the risk of CRC is moderately elevated in BRCA1 but not in BRCA2 mutation carriers. But this meta-analysis included pedigree studies and putative BRCA mutation carriers as many of the included patients did not undergo formal genetic testing. Cullinane et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] conducted a meta-analysis of seven cohort and four case&#8211;control studies and reported no significant increase in CRC risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Both of the systematic reviews included studies prior to 2018. Our meta-analysis updated two recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and drew interesting conclusions that BRCA1/2 gene mutations were increased in patients with CRC. The Fujita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] 2020 study had a high relative weight in both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 subgroup analyses, which may be one reason why the results of this study differ from those of other studies. Besides, the development of genome sequencing technology may be another vital reason.</p><p id="Par29">Most studies used Sanger sequencing, named as first-generation sequencing technology. This technique can only obtain one sequence per reaction and the sequencing throughput is very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning approximately 110&#160;kb of DNA; it is difficult to cover the complete sequence through the Sanger sequencing. Thus, based on Sanger sequencing, the early cohort research concentrated on only fewer mutation sites of a gene. For example, Niell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] only investigated the association between the mutations of BRCA1 187delAG and 5385insC and BRCA2 6174delT and increased risk of CRC in 1422 cases and 1566 controls. Genome sequencing became even more far reaching along with the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods in 2005. The biggest advantage of second-generation sequencing over first-generation sequencing is its high throughput and low cost per base, which greatly promotes the popularization of gene sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Two studies( Dobbins et al. and Akcay et al.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which used second-generation sequencing, were included in the present meta-analysis. These studies provided more intact data and made our conclusions more significant. However, no technique is absolutely perfect and the technological limitations of NGS remain. Short reads, assembly of a large number of short fragments and PCR amplification make it easy to cause information loss and reduce the accuracy of sequencing when detecting complex repetitive sequences or long copy number variants. The third-generation single-molecule sequencing technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] performs de novo sequencing on a single long sequence and can be used to find long-fragment variants on the human genome, creating accurate human genome maps. While the technology is currently limited to the laboratory setting, it is believed that third-generation sequencing could be used in the clinic to identify potential long copy number genetic mutations in the near future.</p><p id="Par30">The present meta-analysis has several limitations. First, we must acknowledge the presence of heterogeneity in the study design of the literature. Several articles included only Ashkenazi Jews, who had higher odds of BRCA mutations. A subgroup analysis was performed to account for this heterogeneity, which suggested that the rate of BRCA mutation remains high in non-Ashkenazi Jews patients with CRC. Besides, Some of the included studies did not distinguish between BRCA1 and BRCA2, and some did not distinguish between colon and rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Some studies examined multiple genes, but in the case of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, only the three most common founder mutations were included in the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The low mutation rates of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in some studies may be due to the detection of only three founder mutations or limited testing technology. We performed subgroup analyses to reduce heterogeneity in study design, but we were unable to perform subgroup analyses according to cancer type, age, and sex, because of the lack of significant statistical data. Second, most of the included studies were retrospective, and only study was prospective, which may lead to a selection bias. We could not control for the effect of other risk factors on the study results, such as diet, smoking and family history. Each study used different effect measures, including OR, SIR and RR, which must be transformed into OR for meta-analysis.</p><p id="Par31">In conclusion, in this meta-analysis, BRCA genes are one of the genes that may increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. We, thus, suggest that BRCA genes could be potential candidates which may be included in the colorectal cancer genetic testing panel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
