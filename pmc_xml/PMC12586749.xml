Although cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) exhibit therapeutic potential in oncology, their mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer (BRCA) remains incompletely characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Gene expression analysis was conducted utilizing UCSC-XENA data alongside <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE20685">GSE20685</ext-link> from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The expression and mutation profiles of BRCA samples were examined using the R software package. Drawing from existing literature on CRGs, a total of 52 CRGs were identified for analysis. Patients were categorized into four distinct CRG subtypes through unsupervised consensus clustering. The MsigDB database facilitated the comparison of pathway differences among the four subtypes, while the distribution of samples across these subtypes and the variations in immune infiltration were also assessed. Genes exhibiting Cox p-values&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001 were selected for further validation. Based on the identified genes, the CRG score (principal component 1&#8201;+&#8201;principal component 2) was computed, and the relationships between classification, CRG score, and prognosis were analyzed. Furthermore, the GSCA database was employed to investigate the expression, mutation, copy number variation, and methylation differences between high and low CRG score groups, alongside their correlations with drug sensitivity and clinical characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In total, 25 CRGs in BRCA were enrolled to identify four distinct subtypes. The expression levels of these CRGs varied among the four subtypes, further elucidating the relationship between clinical characteristics (such as type, stage, TNM classification, metastasis, age, full state and full time) and gene expression. Functional and multi-omic analyses of immune infiltration demonstrated significant variability in immune cell infiltration across various subtypes, including B cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) classified BRCA patients into high and low scoring groups. The analysis revealed that patients in the high-scoring group experienced significantly improved long-term clinical outcomes compared to those in the low-scoring group. Furthermore, survival status, M stage, and recurrence of metastasis indicated that deceased patients, those in M1 stage, and metastatic patients exhibited lower scores. The expression of immune checkpoints in the high CRGs score group was found to be low, alongside a low tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), with few gene mutations observed. This suggests that individuals in the low CRGs group may have a greater opportunity to benefit from immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Through our comprehensive analysis of CRGs, we have elucidated their extensive regulatory effects on immune response, clinical features, and prognosis. The cuproptosis subtype effectively differentiates various clinical and molecular characteristics of BRCA. Additionally, the cuproptosis score emerges as a promising biomarker for predicting BRCA prognosis and assessing the benefits of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12672-025-03884-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cuproptosis</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Subtypes</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>ICI treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Qilu Research Fund Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>XQQL202417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Wanjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most prevalent cancer among female patients, significantly impacting women&#8217;s health worldwide.

Due to its high invasiveness, heterogeneity, and recurrence, despite advancements in chemotherapy and targeted therapies that have improved prognosis, some patients continue to be unable to benefit from these treatments. This situation warrants further in-depth research.</p><p id="Par6">Copper is the second most essential trace element in the human body, significantly influencing the development and function of blood, the central nervous system, the immune system, hair, skin, skeletal tissues, and internal organs such as the brain, liver, and heart. It is involved in numerous biological processes, including the activation of hemoglobin, promotion of iron absorption, and formation of phospholipids and nervous tissue. An imbalance in copper homeostasis can lead to Wilson&#8217;s disease and Menkes disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Clinical trials have shown that cancer metastasis can be inhibited through copper consumption or the disruption of copper homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, copper complexes can mediate mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Cobine PA et al. discovered that copper directly interacts with the fatty acylation component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, resulting in the aggregation of fatty proteins and subsequent loss of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. This mechanism is distinct from the known modes of controlled cell death, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, and is therefore termed &#8216;copper death&#8216; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Recent studies have revealed the significant potential of cuproptosis-related genes in predicting prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity across various tumor types. Researchers have constructed a cuproptosis-related prognostic model specifically for pancreatic cancer, demonstrating that patients classified in the high-risk group exhibited poorer outcomes (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.00557). This risk model achieved an AUC value significantly exceeding 0.7, indicating enhanced accuracy in predicting the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between the mRNA expression levels of several cuproptosis genes (including DLAT, DLD, GLS, LIPT1, MTF1, and PDHB) and the infiltration levels of B cells, CD8 + T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Current research on cuproptosis genes and tumor immunotherapy predominantly employs methods such as the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm to assess the responsiveness to immunotherapy. Notably, no studies have yet analyzed the association between the differential expression of cuproptosis-related genes and clinicopathological characteristics, as well as prognosis, by collecting local clinical data. While CRGs demonstrate prognostic utility across various malignancies, their role in BRCA remains undefined.

Based on the prognostic genes identified, we categorized 1,440 BRCA patients into different molecular genetic categories through consensus clustering analysis.

Consistent with the expected cuproptosis patterns, we observed significant variations in the expression of CRGs across the four gene subtype groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the four genetic subtypes and the clinical characteristics of BRCA patients, discovering that the pathological types of gene clusters A and D were predominantly luminal A and B (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). Subsequently, PCA analysis stratified BRCA patients into high and low scoring groups. This analysis revealed that patients in the high-scoring group demonstrated a significant advantage in long-term survival outcomes compared to those in the low-scoring group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). A LASSO Cox regression model was developed to predict a CRGs score for each patient based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with subtypes. The results illustrated the relationship between the two classifications: score and survival status (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G).

Significant differences were observed in the CLL family, IL family, TGF family, among others (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). Furthermore, we examined the correlation between CRG scores and 50 hallmark pathways, revealing that GSVA correction indicated positive correlations with ESTROGEN RESPONSE, BILE ACID METABOLISM, MYOGENESIS, and TGF-&#946; SIGNALING, while negative correlations were found with MTORC1 SIGNALING, G2M CHECKPOINT, E2F TARGETS, and GLYCOLYSIS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B). Additionally, we investigated the relationship between immune checkpoints and CRG scores in 1,424 BRCA patients. The results demonstrated a decreasing trend in the expression of CD247, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, and TIGIT as CRG scores increased (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C). To provide further support, we analyzed TMB in high and low CRG score groups using the R maftools package. In the SCORE-HIGH group, alterations were identified in 371 (65.2%) of 569 samples, while the SCORE-LOW group exhibited alterations in 319 (77.62%) of 411 samples, with missense mutations constituting the majority of these changes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A, B). Moreover, a significant difference in gene mutations was observed between the high and low CRGs score groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>C).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Immunotherapy validation and drug sensitivity prediction of Non immunotherapy</title><p id="Par32">The expression of immune checkpoints in the high CRGs score array was found to be low, with both TMB and MSI also exhibiting low levels, alongside a scarcity of gene mutations. This led to the hypothesis that the efficacy of immunotherapy in this population is limited. To validate this hypothesis, immunotherapy data were analyzed. OS results in melanoma revealed that the low-CRG-score cohort demonstrated a superior treatment response compared to the high-score group, with a p-value of 0.028 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>A). Similar findings were observed in the OS of urothelial carcinoma, as well as in the OS and progression-free survival (PFS) of KIRC, with p-values of 0.018, 0.0037, and 0.0017 respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>B, C). Furthermore, we utilized the pRRophetic package in R to predict the IC50 values for various anticancer drugs across each sample, comparing the differences between high and low CRGs score groups. A higher IC50 indicates reduced treatment sensitivity. We identified six sensitive and six insensitive samples (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). Finally, we summarized the correlation between gene expression and the sensitivity of the top 30 CTRP and GDSC drugs across pan-cancer (Sup-Fig.&#160;5).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">Molecular biology research on tumors indicates that the identification of new predictive and therapeutic targets, based on the development of prognostic-related genes, has emerged as a prominent area in clinical treatment strategies for BRCA-related cancers. Recent studies have identified a novel form of cell death termed Cuproposis. Copper is known to play a critical role in cancer progression. Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of copper contributes to oncogenesis through mechanisms such as inflammatory signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Excessive copper accumulation in cells leads to mitochondrial protein aggregation, resulting in protein modification, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The discovery of cuproptosis significantly enhances our understanding of copper metabolic diseases and their underlying molecular mechanisms. This knowledge holds substantial value for the identification of potential pharmacological agents aimed at treating copper metabolic disorders. However, given the heterogeneity of BRCA, the classification of CRGs in BRCA offers a reliable foundation for therapeutic strategies. Consequently, we employed various bioinformatics analysis methods to investigate the theoretical framework of copper toxicity-related genes in BRCA typing, signaling mechanisms, immunotherapy, and the assessment of drug sensitivity in immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par36">Our study identified four distinct molecular subtypes based on CRGs. The prognosis for subtype C and subtype D was significantly better than that for subtype A and subtype B. Cox regression analysis and KM analysis indicated that high expression levels of ATP7B, DAXX, LIPT1, MAP1LC3A, and MT1M were associated with a favorable prognosis. Conversely, elevated levels of BACE1, DLAT, DLST, and SLC31A1 were significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Additionally, immune infiltration within the microenvironment of BRCA played a crucial role in disease progression. Furthermore, we continued to investigate immune infiltration alongside functional and multi-omic analyses across the four subtypes. Significant variability in immune cell infiltration was observed between the different subtypes, including B cells and MDSC. GO analysis revealed that these differential genes are associated with functions such as transmembrane signaling, extracellular matrix binding, and chromosomal regulation. KEGG analysis indicated that these differential genes are involved in pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the PPAR signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and the cell cycle. We further explored the relationship between the four genetic subtypes and the clinical characteristics of BRCA patients, revealing significant discrepancies. PCA categorized breast cancer patients into high and low score groups. Our findings indicated that survival status, M stage, and recurrence of metastasis were associated with lower scores; specifically, deceased patients, those with M1 stage, and metastatic patients exhibited lower scores. Notably, there were significant differences in gene mutations between the high and low CRGs score groups. The expression of immune checkpoints in the high CRGs score array was low, with both TMB and MSI also being low, indicating a scarcity of gene mutations. This suggests that individuals in the high CRGs group are less likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Furthermore, our multi-cohort validation across melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and urothelial carcinoma confirmed the translational utility of the CRG score in predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response. Clinical prognostic results in melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, and KIRC demonstrated that the low score group significantly benefited from immunotherapy compared to the high score group. Additionally, the prediction of IC50 values for each sample across various anticancer drugs revealed that higher IC50 values corresponded to reduced treatment sensitivity.</p><p id="Par37">Copper is not only a crucial component of numerous essential enzymes but also serves as a key regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that, compared to healthy individuals, cancer patients exhibit significantly elevated average levels of serum and tumor copper, particularly in cases of BRCA, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, gynecological malignancies, and bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The abnormal accumulation of copper within cells can selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, some studies indicate that copper plays a role in promoting cell proliferation, stimulating angiogenesis, and facilitating metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, there is currently no direct evidence to verify which CRGs influence the biological behavior of tumor cells. Recent studies indicate that cuproptosis plays a vital role in human tumors. Zhu et al. investigated the reliability of CRGs in predicting prognosis and immune response in patients with low-grade glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Based on five CRGs, Shao et al. established an effective application of CRGs to develop an improved prognostic model for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Wei Y, et al. demonstrated the potential of CRGs in guiding the prognosis, treatment, and immunological characteristics of AML patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Li et al. identified two cuproptosis-related subtypes and investigated the characteristics of TME infiltration, as well as the development of a prognostic model in BRCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This study found a correlation between the clinical characteristics, gene expression, and subtypes of BRCA patients. Additionally, the differences in immune cell infiltration across various subtypes were inconsistent. The high-score array derived from PCA analysis exhibited characteristics of low expression of immune checkpoints, low MSI, and a limited number of gene mutations. Zeng et al. discovered a negative correlation between the risk index of cuproptosis-related lipid metabolism genes and the expression of most immune checkpoints, which aligns with our research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is speculated that patients in the low-score group may benefit from immunotherapy. Building on previous studies, we further analyzed additional genotyping studies of CRGs in BRCA using diverse databases and bioinformatics techniques, and validated our findings with a greater number of relevant differential genes. To enhance the reliability of the study, we integrated the efficacy of immunotherapy with the prediction of drug sensitivity for non-immunotherapy treatments, thereby jointly establishing the scientific basis for the clinical treatment of subtype studies.</p><p id="Par38">This study, however, presents certain limitations. Firstly, the inherent heterogeneity and potential quality issues related to public database data&#8212;such as sequencing noise, missing sample information, and clinical annotation errors&#8212;may undermine the robustness and reproducibility of the analyses. Consequently, this could result in reduced statistical power in specific association analyses (e.g., differential expression, survival analysis) or the generation of false positives and negatives. Secondly, the exclusive reliance on bioinformatic analysis of public data prevents direct wet-lab validation of molecular mechanisms, causal relationships, or specific biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This limitation restricts our capacity to gain deeper insights into the biological principles underlying the findings (e.g., key genes, pathways, prognostic models) and hinders confirmation of their causal roles. To enhance the credibility of our findings, we employed multiple complementary bioinformatic approaches. Core findings were validated across various datasets; functional enrichment analysis provided insights into potential biological mechanisms; and other computational methods, such as network analysis and drug sensitivity prediction, offered corroborative evidence. Additionally, results were compared and discussed in the context of previously published experimental evidence. Nonetheless, the key discoveries generated by this study necessitate subsequent in vitro and in vivo experimental validation (e.g., gene knockout/overexpression, cellular functional assays, animal models) to confirm their functional roles and mechanisms. This represents a critical next step in translating computational findings into clinical or biological understanding. Furthermore, repeated mining of public datasets may lead to what is termed &#8216;salmon-colored ocean competition,&#8217; which poses challenges for secondary analyses based solely on the same data sources, potentially hindering the generation of truly disruptive and original insights. Such studies may be limited to validating known findings, refining existing models, or applying established methods to specific subgroups. It is essential to position this study accurately: as a computational study based on public resources, its primary contributions lie in systematic analysis, resource integration, hypothesis generation, and the provision of a prioritized research agenda&#8212;not in replacing experimentally driven primary discoveries. Its objective is to inform and support subsequent original experimental and clinical investigations. Ultimately, achieving truly breakthrough innovations in the future will necessitate the close integration of computational findings with original experimental designs, the generation of novel data types (e.g., single-cell, spatial omics, and novel models), or prospective clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">This study demonstrates that CRGs are closely associated with the TME, clinicopathological characteristics, and prognosis of breast cancer, positioning them as potential prognostic tools for patient outcomes.
