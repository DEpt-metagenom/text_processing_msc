Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation-driven immune dysregulation plays a pivotal role in breast cancer progression and therapy resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing and comprehensive gene network analysis based on inflammation identified FLT3LG as a crucial protective factor in breast cancer. Tumors with lower FLT3LG expression showed poorer survival outcomes across multiple patient cohorts. Functional analysis revealed its role in immune regulation, particularly in the activation of B cells and T cells, as well as in chemokine signaling. Genetic profiling revealed distinct mutation patterns: PIK3CA mutations were enriched in tumors with high FLT3LG expression, whereas TP53 mutations predominated in tumors with low FLT3LG expression. Correlations with immune cell infiltration and checkpoint markers suggested that FLT3LG may predict enhanced responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors and certain targeted drugs. These findings support its potential as a multifunctional biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic decision making in breast cancer.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10238-025-01889-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BRCA</kwd><kwd>FLT3LG</kwd><kwd>Single-cell sequencing analysis</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, with tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment (TME) dynamics driving therapeutic resistance and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The TME is a complex ecosystem composed of malignant epithelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular cells, and a diverse array of immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These cellular components engage in intricate cross talk through direct contact and secretory signals, collectively sculpting an immunosuppressive or immunoreactive niche that either supports or restrains tumor progression. Central to these processes is chronic inflammation, a hallmark of cancer that fosters proliferation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling while simultaneously shaping immune evasion. Inflammation-related genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and signaling mediators act as critical orchestrators of these cell&#8211;cell communications and functional outcomes within the TME. Inflammation-related genes are critical mediators of these processes, yet their roles in BRCA at single-cell resolution remain underexplored.</p><p id="Par3">FLT3LG (FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand), a cytokine essential for dendritic cell (DC) development and hematopoiesis, has emerged as a regulator of antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. FLT3LG, produced predominantly by NK cells, plays a crucial role in regulating the abundance of stromal dendritic cells (SDCs) in tumors, enhancing T cell responses. Additionally, NK cells and SDCs correlate with improved patient outcomes and responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, its prognostic significance and immune functions in BRCA are unclear.

Our study identifies FLT3LG as a protective biomarker in BRCA, with high expression correlating with improved survival outcomes and enhanced immune infiltration. We uncovered inflammation-related gene modules by integrating scRNA-seq and hdWGCNA, highlighting the dynamic interplay between TME components and tumor progression. In this study, FLT3LG&#8217;s association with immune cells (T cells, B cells, NK cells) aligns with its established role in DC activation and hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Notably, FLT3LG&#8217;s negative correlation with stimulatory cytokines (CXCL9, CCL5) but a positive association with inhibitory checkpoints (PDCD1, CTLA4) may reflect a robust role: While promoting immune cell infiltration, it simultaneously prevents excessive immune exhaustion. This duality mirrors observations in PD-1-responsive tumors, where checkpoint expression often correlates with preexisting but restrained immune activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The mutational dichotomy between high and low FLT3LG groups, PIK3CA versus TP53 mutations, resonates with established BRCA subtypes. PIK3CA mutations, prevalent in luminal tumors, are linked to hormone receptor positivity and sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Conversely, TP53 mutations dominate basal-like BRCA, a subtype characterized by aggressive behavior and chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This divergence suggests that FLT3LG may serve as a biomarker to stratify patients for targeted therapies, such as PI3K inhibitors in FLT3LG-high/PIK3CA-mutant tumors or PARP inhibitors in FLT3LG-low/TP53-mutant cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of MAP3K1/PIK3CA mutations in FLT3LG-high groups aligns with reports of MAP3K1&#8217;s role in ER&#8201;+&#8201;BRCA progression, potentially informing combinatorial therapeutic strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">FLT3LG&#8217;s predictive power for immunotherapy responses, including anti-PD-1 and CAR-T, underscores its clinical relevance. Its positive association with determinants like CYT and IFN&#947;IS echoes findings in melanoma, where high cytolytic activity predicts checkpoint blockade responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The correlation with inhibitory checkpoints (PDCD1, CTLA4) further supports its utility in identifying &#8220;immune-hot&#8221; tumors amenable to immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Notably, FLT3LG&#8217;s dual association with cytotoxic lymphocyte activation and immune checkpoint expression positions it as a potential regulator of tumor immune interactions, particularly in immunologically heterogeneous cancers like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). FLT3LG could help refine patient selection for immune checkpoint blockade. Its association with PD-1 and CTLA4 suggests it may mark tumors with preexisting immune engagement. However, the paradoxical association with both immune activation and suppression warrants caution, as tumors with high FLT3LG may require tailored regimens to overcome inhibitory signals.</p><p id="Par18">FLT3LG&#8217;s link to chemotherapy sensitivity (e.g., Lapatinib, Afatinib) aligns with evidence that EGFR/HER2-targeted therapies are more effective in tumors with active immune infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in HER2&#8201;+&#8201;BRCA, and our data suggest that FLT3LG may enrich for patients likely to benefit from such therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Additionally, the sensitivity to Osimertinib, an EGFR TKI, hints at cross talk between FLT3LG-driven immune signaling and oncogenic pathways, a hypothesis requiring mechanistic validation. Thus, FLT3LG is proposed to be a marker for a specific tumor immune context or differentiation state that may co-occur with therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p id="Par19">While our multi-cohort analysis provides robust correlative insights, the retrospective nature of the study limits causal inference. Variability in scRNA-seq data, such as batch effects or cell type annotation biases, may influence module identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Functional studies are needed to delineate FLT3LG&#8217;s direct role in T cell recruitment and checkpoint regulation. For example, FLT3LG knockout models could clarify its impact on TME remodeling, while co-culture assays may elucidate its interaction with immune modulators like PDCD1. Besides, the potential dual roles of FLT3LG in immune infiltration and exhaustion require functional validation through in vitro and in vivo experiments, such as assessing the impact of FLT3LG modulation on immune cell function and exhaustion states. Advances in single-cell sequencing could also offer deeper insight into FLT3LG-expressing immune subsets, their activation states, and their relationship to immune evasion in breast cancer. Further, our predictions regarding immunotherapy response are reliant on computational biology algorithms (e.g., oncoPredict, BEST) and surrogate biomarkers (e.g., T cell-inflamed GEP) from public databases. Although FLT3LG shows highly significant correlations with these activation signatures, it lacks direct association with clinical response data from cohorts of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or CAR-T cells. Therefore, the predictive value of FLT3LG as a biomarker awaits final confirmation in prospective clinical studies. These data may guide the development of personalized approaches, potentially combining FLT3LG profiling with checkpoint inhibition. Finally, emerging delivery platforms such as biomimetic carriers, including leukosomes, offer novel ways to modulate the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In parallel, microRNA-based therapies targeting immune regulators or modulating FLT3LG expression could enhance immune responses. As interest grows in microRNA-driven gene therapy for immuno-oncology, integrating FLT3LG within these strategies could help shape more effective, personalized treatment combinations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">FLT3LG emerges as a multifaceted &#8220;Inflammation&#8221;-related biomarker in BRCA, bridging prognostic assessment, immune modulation, and therapeutic guidance.
