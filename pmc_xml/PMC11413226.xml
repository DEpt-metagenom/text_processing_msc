However, there is limited research on the role of SASH1 in breast cancer. This manuscript aims to investigate the mechanism of SASH1 in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of breast cancer. Firstly, we obtained RNA-sequencing data of the tumors from the Genomic Data Commons data portal website, along with the corresponding clinical information of patients. Pan-cancer analysis was performed to analyze the expression of SASH1 across all tumors. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between SASH1 expression and the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Then, immunohistochemistry was utilized to evaluate the expression levels of SASH1, p-Akt, p-PI3K, and p-mTOR in breast cancer tissue. Finally, a cell assay was employed to analyze the impact of SASH1 on the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). The results revealed that SASH1 expression is decreased in BRCA, LUSC, LUAD, CESC, ESCA, and COAD. Meta-analysis also found that SASH1 is downregulated in most tumor tissues, and the expression level of SASH1 in breast cancer was significantly lower than that in the control group (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.14, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.08&#8211;0.25; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). Further experimental validation showed that SASH1 expression is significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissue (38.33%, 23/60), and the overexpression of SASH1 can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells accompanied by the suppression of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally, SASH1 overexpression can improve OS and RFS of breast cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SASH1</kwd><kwd>PI3K</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Prognosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Cancer genetics</kwd><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>Oncogenes</kwd><kwd>Tumour biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing</institution></funding-source><award-id>CSTB2022NSCQ-BHX0692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Foundation of Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau and Health Commission Joint medical research project</institution></funding-source><award-id>2022QNXM037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>82201858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Yongchuan District Natural Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>2022yc-jckx20048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Senior Medical Talents Program of Chongqing for Young and Middle-aged</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The development of tumors is a complex, multistage process influenced by various factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Key among these are the activation of proto-oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Breast cancer, which originates from the epithelial tissue of the breast, is the most common malignancy affecting women, particularly those between the ages of 40 and 60 or around the peri-menopausal period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Statistics show that the incidence of breast cancer has been steadily increasing in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. While numerous factors can contribute to its development, genetic factors account for less than 10% of cases, leaving the mechanisms behind the remaining 90% still largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1) is located on chromosome 6q24.3 and has a total length of 7709 bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. It encodes 1247 amino acids and contains one SH3 domain and two SAM domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. SASH1 belongs to the SLY family, which includes other protein members such as SAMSN1 and SASH3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. SAMSN1 primarily functions in B-cell activation, while SASH3 is involved in the specific immune response of organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Notably, SASH1 expression is reduced in various malignant tumors, such as breast, lung, gastric, and thyroid cancers, and its levels are closely linked to tumor proliferation, migration, and prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Current studies highlight a significant connection between SASH1 and tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> confirmed that low expression of SASH1 not only promotes the occurrence of gliomas but also is closely related to the grading of gliomas. In liver cancer and thyroid tumors, the mRNA expression level of SASH1 is notably decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that SASH1 protein expression is significantly downregulated in 74% of breast cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Gong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the positivity rate of SASH1 protein in breast cancer patients is significantly reduced (63/186, 33.9%). Our previous studies have also confirmed that low expression of SASH1 is significantly associated with the occurrence of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that SASH1 may play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer.</p><p id="Par4">The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway relays signals from cell membrane receptors to the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In-depth research on cancer molecular biology has revealed that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway is intimately linked with the initiation, progression, and metastasis of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Abnormal expression of this pathway has been detected in various tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Activation of PI3K triggers the activation of Akt, which becomes phosphorylated to form p-Akt, subsequently regulating downstream gene expression, and mediating tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Miao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> discovered that PI3K-Akt-mTOR expression levels are significantly elevated in breast cancer, facilitating tumor proliferation and drug resistance. Pan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> found that SASH1 can inhibit the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells by blocking the expression of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Nonetheless, there is currently insufficient research to confirm whether an interaction exists between SASH1 and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer. Examining the function and molecular mechanisms of the SASH1 gene could not only shed light on its role in tumor initiation and progression but also lay the groundwork for targeting it in breast cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the role of SASH1 in the onset, development, and prognosis of breast cancer through multiple approaches, including clinical samples, cell experiments, and meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents</title><p id="Par5">Immunohistochemical detection reagents were purchased from OriGene Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

To pool the data, when I<sup>2</sup> test&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;50 or q&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.1, significant heterogeneity between studies is considered, and random effects model (REM) is adopted.

Cell experiments also revealed that overexpression of SASH1 can significantly reduce the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. We examined the correlation between SASH1 and clinical pathological parameters in breast cancer patients, uncovering a relationship between SASH1 expression and both age and SBR grade. Low SASH1 expression was correlated with a higher malignancy level in breast cancer.

Our western blotting results further confirmed this conclusion. However, due to the lack of follow-up data from breast cancer patients, we downloaded data on the relationship between SASH1 and the prognosis of breast cancer patients from the TCGA database.

The downregulation of SASH1 can promote the occurrence, proliferation, and metastasis of breast cancer. Overexpressing SASH1 can suppress the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer accompanied by the inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, SASH1 overexpression may improve OS and RFS in breast cancer patients. Therefore, SASH1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of tumors. However, our study also has certain limitations. For instance, we only validated that SASH1 regulates breast cancer proliferation and metastasis through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in a single cell line. Additionally, we did not follow up on the survival time of breast cancer patients to investigate the impact of SASH1 on patient prognosis. These issues will need to be addressed in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
