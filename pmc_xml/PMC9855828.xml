This study aims to depict the association between the CISD1, the co-expressed genes, and diabetes mellitus to offer potential therapeutic targets for further mechanical research. The TCGA-BRCA RNAseq data is acquired. All the data and analyzed using R packages and web-based bioinformatics tools. CISD1 gene expression was evaluated between tumor bulk and adjacent tissue. Immune cell infiltration evaluation was performed. CISD1 expressed significantly higher in tumor tissue than that of the normal tissue, indicating poor overall survival rates. High expression level of CISD1 in tumor shows less pDC and NK cells penetration. There are 138 genes shared between CISD1 co-expressed gene pool in BRCA and diabetes mellitus related genes using &#8220;diabetes&#8221; as the term for text mining. These shared genes enrich in &#8220;cell cycle&#8221; and other pathways. MCODE analysis demonstrates that p53-independent G1/S DNA damage checkpoint, p53-independent DNA damage response, and ubiquitin mediated degradation of phosphorylated cdc25A are top-ranked than other terms. CISD1 and co-expressed genes, especially shared ones with diabetes mellitus, can be the focused genes considered when addressing clinical problems in breast cancer with a diabetes mellitus background.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CISD1</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Tianjin Medical University</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1704502</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1704502) granted from Ministry of Science and Technology of the People&#8217;s Republic of China.

Introduction</title><p>The most prevalent cancer among women worldwide is breast cancer, with the highest rates found in the most industrialized countries, such as Europe, North America, and Australia [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several mechanisms that enable its progression, including evading apoptosis, dividing indefinitely, enhancing angiogenesis, resisting anti-growth signals, and producing its own growth signals. With a refined understanding of the molecular mechanism, there are many therapeutics in use and in clinical trials [<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, those patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, may face increased risk of suffering breast cancer or worse outcomes with breast cancer [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mechanically, the development of breast cancer might be caused by dyslipidemia [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], hyperinsulinemia [<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and hyperglycemia induced by diabetes mellitus. Thus, metformin [<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], thiazolidinediones [<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and other PPAR&#947; agonists are thought have a potential for cancer prevention, although there are inconsistent results among studies [<xref rid="B10-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cells accumulate iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to promote their metabolic activity and proliferation rate. In contrast, high levels of iron and ROS can also lead to increased oxidative stress and the activation of cell death pathways such as ferroptosis. As a result, different drugs that target iron and/or ROS metabolism have been proposed as anticancer medications. However, diabetes mellitus make it more complicated for the selection of the therapeutic treatments given the sustained hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) play a role in cancer progression and promotion. Thus, personalized medicine and patient treatment based on precise molecular understanding is urgently needed.</p><p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent regulated form of cell death caused by accumulation of lipid-based ROS [<xref rid="B13-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition to mitochondrial shrinkage and increased membrane density, mitochondrial cristae were reduced [<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the past few years, NEET proteins, a newly found iron-sulfur proteins (2Fe-2S), are pivotal players in iron regulation and ROS homeostasis. Specifically, CISD1 (CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1, CISD1&#8212;also known as mitoNEET) performs a key role in in promoting the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth [<xref rid="B15-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It ensures maximal electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation capacity [<xref rid="B16-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Knock-down CISD1 can significantly inhibit cancer cells proliferation and reduce uncontrolled reactive oxygen and iron accumulation [<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since it was reported that pioglitazone could stabilize CISD1, plenty of studies focused on the interaction between mitochondrial function and glutathione reductase metabolism [<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mutant CISD1 can lower glucose level in a model for studying human diabetes-related diseases [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A novel ligand for CISD1 named TT01001 improves diabetes [<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All these achievements demonstrated that CISD1 can be a promising target for both breast cancer and diabetes mellitus cure. However, a more elaborated molecular mechanism is needed for clarifying the interplay between breast cancer, CISD1, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In this study, the RNA-seq data from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to compare normal and tumor samples for CISD1 expression. Integrated bioinformatics methods were performed to examine the correlation between CISD1, co-expressed genes expression levels, and breast cancer clinical pathology features of breast cancer. Furthermore, diabetes mellitus related genes were added to identify the shared molecular pattern with CISD1 related co-expressed genes for future drug design or treatment options. This study aims to offer preliminary data for depicting the association between the CISD1, the co-expressed genes related, and diabetes mellitus to demonstrate the potential therapeutic targets for further mechanical research, even clinical practice when dealing with breast cancer especially those patients with diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-biomolecules-13-00037"><title>2.

Enrichment Analysis of Shared Genes between the Co-Expressed Genes with CISD1 and Diabetes Mellitus</title><p>Given that pioglitazone was a drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was also identified an interaction between pioglitazone and CISD1 in this study, we speculated that CISD1, a key role in ferroptosis, might be a significant target for treating BRCA with diabetes mellitus. Thus, it was necessary to present the correlation between the co-expressed genes with CISD1 in BRCA and diabetes mellitus. As shown in <xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A, there were 138 genes shared both in co-expressed genes with CISD1 and diabetes mellitus. Next, protein&#8211;protein interaction analysis was performed for these shared genes (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B).

Discussion</title><p>Breast cancer has become a serious threat to women&#8217;s health. It is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and is curable in 70&#8211;80% of cases if detected at an early stage and without metastatic spread. Breast cancer is heterogeneous at the molecular level, though there are different treatment strategies for different molecular subtypes. It is considered that targeting at iron and/or ROS metabolism can be used as a new strategy for developing anti-tumor drugs. However, due to the complex mechanism of ROS, most results are mixed. It is still necessary to find new targets that can regulate iron and ROS metabolisms, and perform an important role in tumor growth. In this work, an association between breast cancer and diabetes mellitus has been depicted through identifying the role of a ferroptosis related gene-CISD1.</p><p>The expression of CISD1in breast cancer and its correlation between the life span had been analyzed. CISD1 was positively associated with Overall Survival (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.013). More importantly, detailed clinical information should be considered when grouping. Additionally, a correlation was found between CISD1 expression and clinical features. N stage (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.012), M stage (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.047), Race (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), Age (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.022), Histological type (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), PR status (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), ER status (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), HER2 status, PR status, and PAM50 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were significantly connected with CISD1 expression. These features are worthy to be concerned when making treatment plans for the patients. Next, CISD1 expression level were evaluated and varied in different cancer types (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). It had been reported that loss of CISD1 could inhibit B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells proliferation [<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, deficient CISD1 played a role in aged mice with heart failure [<xref rid="B28-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Defected CISD1 mice showed a Parkinson&#8217;s Disease phenotype [<xref rid="B29-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, over expressed CISD1 could attenuate atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], helped to improve hypoxic&#8211;ischemic injury [<xref rid="B31-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These results showed that, CISD1 might play different role among cell types in tissues or organ systems. Thus, immune infiltration analysis could offer pivotal information for further interventions or mechanism studies. Our results showed that pDC, NK and Th17 and other cells were negatively correlated, while Th2, Th1 and macrophages and other cells were positively correlated with CISD1 expression in breast cancer (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that there might be a link between the high expression level of CISD1 and the inhibited the biological function of pDC and NK cells while might promote the Th2, Th1, and other cell physiological function.</p><p>As demonstrated above, CISD1 played significant roles in different types of symptoms or diseases, and its correlated networks must be varied according to the associated normal physiological or morbid pathological state. Therefore, co-expression genes of CISD1 in breast cancer were studied. Enrichment analysis results showed that these co-expressed genes with CISD1 contributed mostly to systemic lupus erythematosus, taste transduction, and other pathways, which in turn improved that CISD1 was related to immune system function from another perspective (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, chemical-protein analysis had shown that a tested association between CISD1 and pioglitazone [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which indicated that CISD1 might be a critical player both in breast cancer and diabetes mellitus. Thus, it was necessary to find out those shared genes between breast cancer and diabetes mellitus relating to CISD1 for further studies. As shown in <xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A, 138 shared genes were identified between the co-expressed genes with CISD1 and diabetes. Although there was complicated protein&#8211;protein interaction between these genes (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), some of the shared 138 genes had similar trans-factors or regulatory mode (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C, <xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These shared genes were conducted gene enrichment analysis and the result showed that cell cycle and the mitotic cell cycle process obtained higher scores (<xref rid="biomolecules-13-00037-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Targeting at cell cycle helped to inhibit cancer cell division [<xref rid="B34-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the progression of diabetes, changes in &#946; cell mass and decreased beta cell proliferation or growth have been underappreciated. Changes in cell cycle progression enforce regulatory checks and balances on beta cells, similar to all other cells in our body [<xref rid="B35-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Recently, there was a newly discovered mechanism that might be a key route for &#946; cell proliferation regulation. In this work, amino acid availability and ROS levels were believed to be able to regulate postnatal &#946; cell proliferation [<xref rid="B36-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Although CISD1 had been indicated that it contributed to human breast cancer proliferation by inducing tumor growth, more detailed protein&#8211;protein, protein&#8211;nucleic acid interaction information was needed [<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It had been reported that diabetes could be a risk factor for breast cancer [<xref rid="B34-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Studies had demonstrated there were common pathways shared between diabetes and breast cancer [<xref rid="B37-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recently, studies targeting ferroptosis have identified a new strategy to treat breast cancer. Preliminary data supports that targeting CISD proteins could be considered as an effective way to improve hyperglycemia [<xref rid="B38-biomolecules-13-00037" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, chronic diseases, such as diabetes, made it more complex to elaborate therapeutic protocols. Deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism correlated diabetes with breast cancer is imperative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-biomolecules-13-00037"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, an integrated analysis was performed to demonstrate the possible link between breast cancer and diabetes via regulating CISD1 and related genes. This work provided a broader perspective to treat breast cancer and offered preliminary data for further research. However, more experimental evidence is needed to verify whether CISD1 could decrease pDC and NK cells or increase Th2, Th1, and macrophages infiltration. In line with this, the exact molecular mechanism for regulating CISD1 in different pathophysiological conditions could be completed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Pengzhi Dong, the corresponding author, would like to express his sincere gratitude to Yan Zhu for the longstanding support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
