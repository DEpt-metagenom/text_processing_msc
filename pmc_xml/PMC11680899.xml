And the morbidity and mortality of breast cancer have increased rapidly. Immune checkpoints are important to maintain immune tolerance and are regarded as important therapeutic targets. However, research for BRCA were limited to single immune checkpoint-related gene (ICG) and few studies have systematically explored expression profile of Immune checkpoint-related genes or attempted to construct a prognostic gene risk model based on immune checkpoint-related genes. We identified immune checkpoint-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BRCA and normal breast tissues from TCGA database. A 7-gene signature was created by utilizing the univariate Cox regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression method. In addition, we conducted a nomogram to predict the prognostic significance. This tool enables quantitative prediction of patient prognosis, serving as a valuable reference for clinical decision-making, thereby improving patient outcomes. Relationships between our risk model and clinical indicators, TME (Tumor Microenvironment), immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug susceptibility were investigated. A set of in vitro cell assays was conducted to decipher the relationship between MAP2K6 and proliferation, invasion, migration, colony formation and apoptosis rate of breast cancer cells. As a result, we established a prognostic model composed of seven ICGs in BRCA. Based on the median risk score, BRCA patients were equally assigned into two groups of high- and low-risk. High-risk BRCA patients have poorer OS (overall survival) than low-risk patients. In addition, there were remarkable differences between these two groups in clinicopathological features, TME, immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug susceptibility. The results of GO and KEGG analyses indicated that DEGs between the high- and low-risk groups were involved in immune-related biological processes and pathways. GSEA analysis also showed that a number of immune-related pathways were notably enriched in the low-risk group. Finally, results of cell-based assays indicated that MAP2K6 may play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer as a tumor suppressor gene. In conclusion, we created a novel ICG signature that has the potential to predict the survival and drug sensitivity of BRCA patients. Furthermore, this study indicated that MAP2K6 may serve as a novel target for BRCA therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BRCA</kwd><kwd>Immune checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Prognosis</kwd><kwd>Immune cell infiltration</kwd><kwd>Drug susceptibility</kwd><kwd>Cell experiments</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Prognostic markers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par21">As one of the pivotal causes of female death worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, the morbidity and mortality of BRCA have increased rapidly. According to relevant authoritative research data in 2020, BRCA became the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in the whole world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A total of 2.3 million people were diagnosed with breast cancer, accounting for 11.7% of all newly identified cancer cases across both sexes. Additionally, 685,000 deaths were attributed to breast cancer, comprising 6.9% of total cancer-related mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The initiation and progression of breast cancer are known to be influenced by a wide range of risk factors, including obesity, genetic factors, family history and endocrine factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Despite recent significant advancements in surgical treatment, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recent years have also witnessed progress in emerging therapeutic approaches for breast cancer. These include bispecific T-cell engagers, antibody&#8211;drug conjugates, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, oncolytic virus therapy, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, cancer vaccines, pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy, and photodynamic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding, the clinical survival of advanced breast cancer has not been obviously improved. One of the reasons for the worse prognosis of advanced breast cancer is that this disease is a highly heterogeneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although the emergence of novel treatments such as single-cell sequencing technology has significantly advanced efforts to address tumor heterogeneity, especially in highly heterogeneous cancers such as breast cancer, challenges remain in fully resolving this issue. Liu et al. demonstrated that CLEC2D and CRTAM expression levels didn&#8217;t differ significantly among PAM50 breast cancer subtypes. However, KLRB1 expression in the Luminal B subtype was obviously lower compared to other subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The study conducted by Zeng et al. revealed that distinct clusters defined by six pyroptosis-related genes exhibited substantial heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment of BRCA. Patients with lower expression of these pyroptosis-related genes had significantly worse clinical prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, clarifying the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and progression in breast cancer, building an effective prognostic prediction model, and identifying new prognostic biomarkers are essential to reducing the mortality of BRCA.</p><p id="Par22">The emergence of immunotherapy has heralded in a brand-new epoch of cancer fighting in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Literature from Xu et al. manifested that up-regulation of MIR22HG improved T cell infiltration and enhanced the treatment of immunotherapy in colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Evidence from Zhang et al. suggested that CAR-T cell therapy has significantly extended the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Barzaman et al. showed that personalized immunotherapy contributes to improving the prognosis of patients with breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Immune checkpoints expressed on T cells, APCs and tumor cells are important to maintain immune tolerance and are regarded as important therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) was regarded as one of the milestone therapeutic breakthroughs in the history of cancer treatment. ICIs could block immunosuppressive receptors and activate immune system and produce anti-tumor immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have played a long-lasting and significant role in the treatment of cancers. Approximately 10% to 15% of cancer patients can benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. So far, ICIs targeting three different molecules, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4, have been sanctioned by FDA of US. It is worth mentioning that these ICIs and immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) are significantly associated with immunotherapy and prognosis of breast cancer recently. Fang et al. reported that upregulation of CTLA-4 and TIGIT predicted poorer prognosis of BRCA patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The research from Kwapisz et al. suggested that Pembrolizumab has promising effects on patients in early-stage TNBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Triki et al. showed that cytoplasmic CD155 correlated with invasiveness and a worse prognosis; however, the simultaneous presence of membranous CD155 and Tumor Infiltrating natural killer cells exhibited contrasting prognostic significance in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A literature by Wang et al. noted that ENPP1 blockade is a promising breast cancer treatment method that utilizes extracellular cGAMP produced by cancer to control the local activation of STING. Therefore, ENPP1 serves as an innate immune checkpoint within the anticancer cGAMP&#8211;STING pathway in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As the immune checkpoint-related gene with the highest correlation coefficient in our gene signature, MAP2K6 plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of various tumors. Liu et al. found that MAP2K6 and TRIM9s mutually stabilize each other, thereby promoting P38 signaling pathway and inhibiting glioblastoma progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Hickson et al. also indicated that MKK4 and MAP2K6 serve as critical suppressors of metastatic colonization in human ovarian carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we selected this gene for further experimental investigation. However, research on BRCA has been limited to single ICG and few studies have systematically explored expression profile of Immune checkpoint-related genes or attempted to establish a gene risk model based on ICGs with respect to prognosis.</p><p id="Par23">This study aimed to create a risk model to predict prognosis and guide treatment for BRCA patients by classifying them based on immune checkpoint-related genes. We applied the LASSO-Cox technique to establish an ICG-based prognostic signature by using expression profiles from TCGA to acquire the risk score for evaluating prognosis and verified by the GEO dataset. Then, a nomogram was performed to make a prediction regarding the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. We also conducted functional enrichment analysis (GO, KEGG and GSEA) to uncover the fundamental mechanisms. And the relationship between the ICGs signature and TME, immune cell infiltration, immune response and drug sensitivity were performed to promote the recognition of new treatment targets for BRCA. Subsequently, the function of MAP2K6 in BRCA was investigated through in vitro cell experiments, including qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK&#8209;8, transwell, colony-formation and apoptosis assays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par24">RNA sequencing data (count format) of BRCA patients and their clinicopathological features were downloaded from TCGA GDC portal (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository</ext-link>).

Therefore, we enhanced our comprehension of the role of MAP2K6 by doing in vitro cell experiments. PCR and Western blotting assays were performed to determine MAP2K6 expression in human mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) or BRCA cell lines (BT-549, T47D, HCC-1395, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). BRCA cell lines substantiated much lower levels of MAP2K6 than did the MCF-10A examined and the expression level of MAP2K6 was relatively low in BT-549 and MCF-7 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> A and B and Supplementary Fig.&#160;1). Thus, we decided to proceed with MCF-7 and BT-549 in our subsequent experiments. Next, PCR was conducted to validate the efficiency of overexpression of MAP2K6 by lentiviral transduction and overexpression efficiency reached approximately twice the baseline level (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>C). Following successful gene overexpression, the impacts of MAP2K6 on the proliferation and viability of BT-549 and MCF-7 cells were corroborated by utilizing the CCK-8 assay.

For a long time, researchers believed that breast cancer cannot serve as an ideal model for immunotherapy because it may have immune silence. However, a large number of statistics have elucidated that breast cancer is inextricably linked to immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy recently. And some biomarkers were considered to participated in the occurrence and progression of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Although we have used various tumor biomarkers in clinical diagnosis and treatment, single biomarker may not be adequate to predict long-term prognosis and treatment effect.</p><p id="Par55">In recent years, evidence from some research demonstrated that immune checkpoints were closely linked to clinical outcomes and prognosis of different cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

A literature by Geng et al. noted that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and RT might elevate the survival of advanced NSCLC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, there are not sufficient immune checkpoint&#8211;related gene biomarkers and risk models for the survival of BRCA. Based on above facts, we plan to use gene signatures of immune checkpoint to precisely predict the prognosis of BRCA patients and formulate more personalized treatments.</p><p id="Par56">The seven ICGs included in our prognostic model were BATF, CD3D, HLA-DQB2, JUN, MAP2K6, NFKBIE, PAK1. The BATF belongs to the ATF super-family of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. BATF can work with IRF4 to slow down the progression of T cell exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Moreover, BATF is overexpressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and AP-1/BATFs may have important roles in ALCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.

The above studies elucidated the role of seven immune checkpoint-related in various cancers. Nevertheless, there are few relevant literatures to systematically explain the association between these seven genes and the prognosis of BRCA.</p><p id="Par57">In current literature, we first retrieved the gene expression profiles from the TCGA database and identified 22 immune checkpoint-related DEGs in BRCA and normal breast tissues. And two clusters based on immune checkpoint-related DEGs showed notably differences in survival probability, T stage, gender and immune cell infiltration. To further confirm whether these ICGs have prognostic significance in patients with BRCA, we generated a prognostic model composed of seven genes. The prognostic signature enabled us to divided BRCA patients into high- and low-risk group based on median risk score. The results of our analysis showed that high-risk BRCA patients had worse overall survival compared with patients in low-risk subgroup. ROC analysis was conducted to confirm the sensitivity and specificity of the prognostic model. Then we used data from GEO database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE20711">GSE20711</ext-link>) to validate the risk signature. The results of univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis proved that this risk signature was an independent prognostic indicator for BRCA patients. And after analyzed the data from TCGA, we came to the conclusion that lymph node metastasis, T classification, tumor stage and age were notably different between the two risk groups. After that, we construct a nomogram based on our ICGs signature and clinicopathological manifestations. Calibration plots demonstrated that nomogram established by us could accurately predict survival probability for patients with BRCA and stratify risk. Furthermore, we interrogated the correlations between our risk model and TME and immune cell infiltration. Figures from our analysis demonstrated that lower Immune, Stromal, ESTIMATE scores and immune cell infiltration levels were found in high-risk group. Besides, high-risk group have less CD8 T cells, Monocytic lineage, Myeloid dendritic cells and NK cells. Therefore, we can speculate that these results were one of the crucial reasons for the worse survival in the high-risk group. Fortunately, we found that the patients in high-risk group were more sensitive to the drugs presented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. Our results are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted the role of immune checkpoint molecules in breast cancer prognosis. For example, multiple studies have shown that high PD-L1 expression or the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with better outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy. In addition, we found that immune-related gene signatures can stratify patients according to their likelihood of benefiting from immune checkpoint inhibitors, supporting the notion that immune checkpoint molecules play a key role in determining treatment efficacy. This provides a theoretical basis for clinical doctors to develop more accurate personalized treatments for different subgroups of breast cancer patients. We also performed functional analyses and the results of GO and KEGG analyses indicated that DEGs between the high- and low-risk groups participated in immune-related processes and pathways. GSEA also showed that several immune-related pathways were notably concentrated in the low-risk one. Finally, we choose MAP2K6 for further experimental verification to delineate the molecular mechanisms. The results of this study demonstrated that overexpression of MAP2K6 conspicuously suppressed proliferation, invasive and migratory capacities, clonogenic activities and dramatically promoted cell apoptosis in BRCA cells.</p><p id="Par58">Breast cancer resistant to immunotherapy usually shows immunosuppressive TME, which is characterized by increased regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and low cytotoxic T cell infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The resistance pathways of breast cancer to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can be classified into tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms. Tumor-intrinsic mechanisms include alterations in signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/&#946;-catenin, and JAK/STAT, as well as changes in the expression levels of certain genes. Tumor-extrinsic mechanisms involve changes in components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) other than the tumor cell itself, as well as variations in the expression levels of other immune checkpoints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. Due to the resistance of breast cancer to immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only suitable for a subset of patients. Therefore, identifying new immune checkpoint-related genes and biomarkers is particularly important for the future of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Recently, with the emergence of some new biomarkers such as voltage gated sodium channel &#945;-subunit gene SCN9A, it can provide new targets for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that MAP2K6 can serve as a novel target and biological marker for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Drugs targeting the activation of MAP2K6 can be developed and combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to overcome immunotherapy resistance in breast cancer patients.</p><p id="Par59">Genomic profiling and sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or RNA sequencing, enable us to identify genetic mutations and expression patterns that are associated with immune evasion or resistance to treatment. Furthermore, the identification of gene signatures that predict both immune response and treatment outcomes helps refine the selection of biomarkers for prognostic models. These genetic insights can therefore improve model accuracy by incorporating genetic variability into predictions of immune therapy efficacy in future.</p><p id="Par60">Nonetheless, there were some restrictions in our research. Firstly, our experiments are primarily conducted in vitro with subsequent need for further in vivo experiments to validate the reliability of our findings. Secondly, the specific mechanism of MAP2K6 in breast cancer requires further investigation. Thirdly, since our study was primarily based on existing databases, the diversity of the included samples in TCGA database was limited, leading to selection bias in the results. Therefore, additional large-scale, multi-center and multi-racial study samples are required to more thoroughly validate the findings and increase the generalizability of our conclusions. Finally, the study relied on TCGA and GEO retrospective cohort studies, thus prospective cohorts are needed to corroborate the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">In conclusion, we created a novel ICG signature with the potential to predict the survival and drug sensitivity of BRCA patients.
