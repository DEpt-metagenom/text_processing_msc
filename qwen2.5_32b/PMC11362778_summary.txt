This study evaluated the combination of olaparib and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) and germline BRCA mutations (BRCAm). Here are the key points:

1. Study Design:
   - OPHELIA was a phase II, open-label, single-arm study.
   - It enrolled 5 patients from January to June 2023.

2. Patient Population:
   - Patients had HER2-positive ABC and BRCA1/2 germline mutations.
   - They were pre-treated with trastuzumab and other systemic therapies.

3. Treatment Regimen:
   - Olaparib (300 mg BID) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg Q3W).
   - Dose reductions of olaparib occurred in 2 patients due to toxicity.

4. Primary Endpoint:
   - The primary endpoint was met, with the combination showing efficacy and safety.

5. Key Findings:
   - Despite limited enrollment, the study suggests potential benefit from combining olaparib and trastuzumab.
   - One patient achieved a partial response (PR), while another had stable disease (SD) for 10 months.

6. Safety Profile:
   - The combination was generally well-tolerated.
   - No grade 4 or 5 adverse events were reported.

7. Conclusion:
   - This is the first study to evaluate olaparib in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive ABC and BRCAm.
   - The findings support further investigation of this regimen in larger, randomized trials.

8. Limitations:
   - Small sample size due to slow accrual.
   - Premature termination of the study.

9. Future Directions:
   - The authors recommend conducting phase III studies to confirm these preliminary results.

This study provides valuable insights into potential new treatment options for patients with HER2-positive ABC and BRCA mutations, highlighting the importance of combining PARP inhibitors with targeted therapies in this patient population.
