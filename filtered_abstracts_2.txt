BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a critical 
pathogen in healthcare settings, associated with high mortality due to its 
extensive antibiotic resistance. In this study, we report an outbreak of CRKP in 
a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within a 200-bed tertiary hospital. The 
main goal of this study was to characterize the phenotypic and genomic profiles 
of the CRKP isolates involved in the outbreak and to gain insights into their 
resistance mechanisms and transmission dynamics within the NICU.
METHODS: The study was conducted between November and December 2023 in a 5-bed 
NICU. Monthly surveillance cultures were performed to monitor colonization and 
infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. CRKP isolates were obtained from 
blood and nasal swabs of affected neonates. Identification and antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing were initially conducted using the Vitek®2 system with an 
N-395 card and further confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling were performed to identify 
resistance genes and virulence factors. For genetic analysis, both Illumina 
short-read and Nanopore long-read sequencing were used, followed by hybrid 
assembly for enhanced genome resolution. Plasmid and resistance gene profiles 
were determined using AMRFinder and PlasmidFinder databases.
RESULTS: A total of three CRKP isolates (designated Kp1, Kp2, and Kp3) were 
identified. Kp1 and Kp2 belonged to sequence type (ST) ST23 and were genetically 
near-identical, differing by a single allele, while Kp3 was of a distinct 
sequence type, ST2096, with 245 allelic differences from Kp1 and Kp2. All 
isolates were resistant to colistin and carried resistance genes, including 
mcr-1 and bla NDM-1, bla KPC2 confirming carbapenem resistance. Efflux pump 
genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes were also detected, providing a 
multifaceted defence against antibiotics. Plasmid analysis identified several 
incompatibility groups (IncFI, IncHI, IncFIB, IncX), indicating the potential 
for horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the complexity of CRKP outbreaks in neonatal 
care, with isolates exhibiting resistance mechanisms that complicate treatment. 
The plasmid profiles suggest these strains are reservoirs for 
multidrug-resistant genes, emphasizing the need for strict infection control and 
ongoing genomic surveillance. For neonatal care, these resistance challenges 
increase the risk of treatment failures and mortality, underscoring the 
importance of enhanced infection prevention and novel therapeutic strategies.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella Enteritidis has 
highlighted the importance of regularly monitoring for the occurrence of 
antibiotic-resistant strains. The current study combined phenotyping analysis 
and whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) to investigate the associations between the 
antibiotic-resistant phenotypes (ARPs) and genetic characteristics determinants 
in 95 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from retail meat and environmental samples 
in China (2014-2019). Phenotypic analyses revealed that 70 isolates (73.68%) 
were MDR with 12 distinct resistance patterns. Most MDR strains (81.43%) had 
NAL-AMP-FIS-STR ± TET profiles, showing a fluctuating trend from 2015 to 2019, 
likely influenced by tetracycline withdrawal management. WGS identified four 
types of mutations in the gyrA gene were associated with nalidixic acid 
resistance. The co-carrying of bla TEM, sul2 and aph(6)-Id/aph(3″)-Ib was likely 
mediated by an X1-type plasmid, corresponding to resistance against ampicillin, 
sulfisoxazole, and streptomycin. Combining phenotypic analyses and WGS data, the 
31 sequenced strains were primarily divided into two clusters, with most 
epidemic resistant strains in the largest cluster A. Identical ARP patterns 
observed across different sample types, regions, and isolation years but 
clustering together in cluster A suggested potential cross-contamination within 
the retail chain. Cluster B exhibited more diverse resistance patterns and 
genetic characteristics. Notably, three isolates in cluster B require special 
mention: a monophasic strain resistant to eight antibiotics, a strain exhibiting 
highly heteroresistance, and a strain with additional exotoxin genes. These 
results highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and the utility of WGS 
to track and understand antibiotic resistance in Salmonella Enteritidis.

INTRODUCTION: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a significant pregnancy 
condition characterized by the fetus failing to attain its full genetic growth 
potential. FGR is primarily ascribed to defective placentation, owing to 
impaired trophoblast cellular function. The objective of this research is to 
elucidate the pathogenic functions of suppressor of Mek1 (SMEK1) in FGR.
METHODS: Western blot and Immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression 
and localization of SMEK1 in placenta. We overexpressed and knocked down SMEK1 
using plasmid or siRNA special targeted it. EdU Assay, flow cytometry, Western 
blot, Wound healing migration and Transwell insert assay were used to detect the 
influence of SMEK1 on cellular function. The mechanism of SMEK1 in regulating 
the migration of JEG3 cells was predicted by employing transcriptomics and 
bioinformatics analysis, and was validated by Western blot.
RESULTS: The expression of SMEK1 was downregulated in FGR placentas. The 
aberrant expression of SMEK1 in JEG3 cells is associated with cell migration and 
invasion, but not with proliferation, or apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis and 
Western blots indicate that knockdown of SMEK1 inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
pathway. A significant inhibition was observed in the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) process of JEG3 cells within the SMEK1 knockdown group. The 
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway partially restored the impaired 
migration and invasive ability due to SMEK1 knockdown in JEG3 cells.
DISCUSSION: the reduction of SMEK1 may contribute to the development of FGR by 
hindering the EMT process of trophoblast cells through modulation of the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli are well-known bacteria commonly 
associated with foodborne illnesses in humans and animals. Genomic 
characterization of these pathogens provides valuable insights into their 
evolution, virulence factors and resistance determinants. This study aimed to 
characterized previously isolated Salmonella (n = 14) and E. coli (n = 19) from 
milk, meat and its associated utensils in Ghana using whole-genome sequencing. 
Most of the Salmonella serovars (Fresno, Plymouth, Infantis, Give and Orleans) 
identified in this study are yet to be reported in Ghana. Most Salmonella 
isolates were pan-sensitive, but genes conferring resistance to fosfomycin 
(fosA7.2) and tetracycline (tet(A)) were detected in one and three isolates, 
respectively. Seven of the Salmonella isolates carried the IncI1-I(Gamma) 
plasmid replicon. Although antimicrobial resistance was not common among 
Salmonella strains, most (11/19) of the E. coli strains had at least one 
resistance gene, with nearly half (8/19) being multidrug resistant and carried 
plasmids. Three of the 19 E. coli strains belonged to serovars commonly 
associated with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) pathotype. While strains 
belonging to virulence-associated lineages lacked key plasmid-encoded virulence 
plasmids, several plasmid replicons were detected in most of the E. coli (14/19) 
strains. Food contaminated with these pathogens can serve as a vehicle for 
disease transmission, posing a significant public health risk and necessitating 
stringent food safety and hygiene practices to prevent outbreaks. Hence, there 
is need for continuous surveillance and preventive measures to stop the spread 
of foodborne pathogens and reduce the risk of associated illnesses in Ghana.

Two main Klebsiella pneumoniae pathotypes are of public health concern, 
classical K. pneumoniae (cKP), with high antibiotic resistance acquisition 
capacity, and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP). The emergence of hypervirulent 
and antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae, especially carbapenem resistance, is 
worrisome and require effective methods for detection and treatment. Different 
evolutionary paths contribute to the emergence of hypervirulence and antibiotic 
resistance, commonly via the acquisition of resistance plasmids by hvKP 
(CR-hvKP) or the acquisition of virulence plasmids by CRKp (hv-CRKp). ST11-KL64 
together with blaKPC-2, is the most extended hv-CRKP lineage acquiring virulence 
plasmids with associated biomarkers, rmpA, rmpa2, iroBCDEN, iucABCDiutA, and 
peg344. In addition to ST11, other hv-CRKP clones have been reported in Europe 
such as ST101, ST147 and ST512, highlighting the association of ST147 with 
OXA-48 and NDM carbapenemases. Although still very rare in Spain, hvKP cases are 
increasing in recent years, mainly due to ST23-K1, ST380-K2 and ST86-K2. 
Management of hvKP infections requires active antibiotic therapy based primarily 
on antibiotic susceptibility patters and site of infection.

Endodontic infections, often involving multispecies bacterial communities, 
present significant challenges in treatment due to their complex pathogenic 
mechanisms and resistance to conventional therapies. Enterococcus faecalis is a 
facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacterium that has been frequently recovered 
from secondary or persistent endodontic infections. This study investigates the 
population structure, resistome, mobilome, and virulome of E. faecalis isolated 
from oral cavity sources, focusing on 22 genomes sequenced from saliva and root 
canal samples. The genome sequence analysis revealed a diversity of 14 sequence 
types (STs), highlighting genetic variability within oral E. faecalis 
populations. Virulence profiling identified 39 genes involved in adherence, 
biofilm formation, toxin production, stress response, and immune evasion. 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, including lsa(A), efrA, and tetM, were 
prevalent across all genomes, indicating potential multidrug resistance. Mobile 
genetic elements (MGEs), such as insertion sequences, transposons, prophages, 
and plasmids, were also identified, facilitating genetic exchange within and 
between species. Network analyses identified central virulence genes (e.g., 
asa1, gelE) and AMR genes (e.g., ANT (6)-Ia, dfrE) crucial for pathogenicity and 
resistance, highlighting their pivotal roles in E. faecalis infections. This 
study provides comprehensive insights into the genomic characteristics, AMR 
genes, virulence factors, and genetic mobile elements associated with E. 
faecalis isolates from the oral cavity, offering implications for dental health 
and potential strategies for infection control and treatment.

Carbapenem and colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae pose a significant 
threat to public health, particularly in intensive care units, due to high 
morbidity and mortality rates. This study aimed to analyze five NDM 
carbapenemase-producing multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from 
different hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, hypermucoviscosity 
analysis, biofilm production assessment, MLST, PCR, and whole-genome sequencing 
were conducted. All isolates harbored NDM-5 metallo-β-lactamase, belonging to 
MLST 307, were biofilm producers and exhibited a stop codon (Q30) along MgrB. 
Genomic analysis revealed multiple-replicon plasmids carrying resistance genes, 
notably blaNDM-5, blaCTX-M-15, rmtB, and qnrB1, with complex genetic structures 
encoding several mobile genetic elements, including the Tn3 family and IS26. All 
isolates harbored wzi173 (capsule-locus KL102), iutA (a siderophore-associated 
gene), and the type 3 fimbriae mrkABCDFHIJ operon. The core genome single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis suggests the circulation of two strains 
of ST307 clone (SNPs range differences 4-77). These findings highlight the 
potential plasticity of the high-risk ST307 clone and the urgent need for 
surveillance and intervention strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance. To 
our knowledge, this is the first report of K. pneumoniae ST307 carrying blaNDM-5 
and the first description of ST307 in Uruguay. The presence of blaNDM-5 and 
pan-aminoglycoside resistance rmtB genes are identified for the first time in 
Uruguay.

BACKGROUND: In Pakistan, acute respiratory infections (ARI) continue to be a 
major public health problem. However, there is still a lack of scholarly work 
regarding different environmental and socioeconomic influencing factors and how 
they interact with respiratory infections. Furthermore, we do not know much 
about geographic variation in this context. Therefore, our study examines the 
ecological-level spatial and temporal patterns of acute respiratory infection 
incidence (ARI) and their geographic relationship with selected socio-economic, 
meteorological, and air pollution factors in Pakistan.
METHODS: We applied the spatiotemporal scan statistics to examine the purely 
temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal clusters of ARI in South Punjab, Pakistan 
for five years (2016-2020). Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and geographically 
weighted regression (GWR) were also applied to model the linear and non-linear 
spatial relationships between selected variables and ARI.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that in the central and northern regions of 
Pakistan, two spatial clusters of ARI were present, accounting for 28.5% of the 
total cases. A spatiotemporal cluster with a relative risk of 1.57 was 
discovered in the northeastern area. The results obtained from the season-based 
GLM highlighted the significance of climatic factors (temperature, fog, dust 
storms) and air pollutants (NO2) in influencing ARI incidence, while 
socio-economic variables (rural population, literacy) had limited impact. In 
addition, GWR revealed that the relationships between predictors and ARI 
incidence varied across locations, emphasizing the importance of considering 
local settings. Season-based non-stationary GLM revealed a multifaceted 
interaction among socio-economic, meteorological, and air pollution factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence about environmental and socio-economic 
factors significantly associated with ARI incidence. In addition, this study 
provides the first baseline of ARI cases in Pakistan to plan for intervention 
and adaptation strategies and may be replicated in other regions of comparable 
settings worldwide.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is recognized by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) as one of the top priority pathogens. Despite its public 
health importance, genomic data of clinical isolates from Malaysia remain 
scarce. In this study, whole-genome sequencing was performed on 126 A. baumannii 
isolates collected from the main tertiary hospital in the state of Terengganu, 
Malaysia, over a 10-year period (2011-2020). Antimicrobial susceptibilities 
determined for 20 antibiotics belonging to 8 classes showed that 77.0% 
(n=97/126) of the isolates were categorized as multidrug resistant (MDR), with 
all MDR isolates being carbapenem resistant. Multilocus sequence typing analysis 
categorized the Terengganu A. baumannii clinical isolates into 34 Pasteur and 44 
Oxford sequence types (STs), with ST2Pasteur of the Global Clone 2 lineage 
identified as the dominant ST (n=76/126; 60.3%). The ST2Pasteur isolates could 
be subdivided into six Oxford STs with the majority being ST195Oxford (n=35) and 
ST208Oxford (n=17). Various antimicrobial resistance genes were identified with 
the bla OXA-23-encoded carbapenemase being the predominant acquired 
carbapenemase gene (n=90/126; 71.4%). Plasmid-encoded rep genes were identified 
in nearly all (n=122/126; 96.8%) of the isolates with the majority being Rep_3 
family (n=121). Various virulence factors were identified, highlighting the 
pathogenic nature of this bacterium. Only 14/126 (11.1%) of the isolates were 
positive for the carriage of CRISPR-Cas arrays with none of the prevalent 
ST2Pasteur isolates harbouring them. This study provided a genomic snapshot of 
the A. baumannii isolates obtained from a single tertiary healthcare centre in 
Malaysia over a 10-year period and showed the predominance of a single closely 
related ST2Pasteur lineage, indicating the entrenchment of this clone in the 
hospital.

INTRODUCTION: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sequence type 
(ST) 45 is a major global MRSA lineage with huge strain diversity and a high 
clinical impact. In Hainan and Guangzhou of China, the ST45-MRSA was mainly 
associated with t116.
METHODS: The MRSA strain SA2107 was isolated from the sputum of a 5-year-old 
child with pneumonia. The whole genome of SA2107 was sequence using Illumina 
(Novaseq 6000) and PacBio (Sequel IIe) sequencers, and the sequences were 
assembled using hybrid assembly. The carriage of antibiotic resistance genes, 
virulence genes, and mobile genetic elements were identified using 
bioinformatics tools. The comparative genomic analyses of MRSA strain SA2107 
with other MRSA strains worldwide were performed.
FINDINGS: The genome size of ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 MRSA strain SA2107 was 
~2.9 Mb. Mobile genetic elements analysis of SA2107 revealed two plasmids 
(30,064-bp pSA2107-1 and 8,033-bp pSA2107-2), three prophages, two integrative 
and conjugative elements (ICEs), and two insertion sequences (ISs, IS431 and 
IS1272). The SCCmec IVa (2B) carried by SA2107 contained the class B mec gene 
complex (IS431-mecA-ΔmecR1-IS1272) and type 2 ccr gene complex (ccrA2 and 
ccrB2). Besides mecA, another beta-lactam resistance gene blaZ was found to 
located on six copies of bla complex (blaZ, blaR1, and blaI) on the chromosome 
of SA2107. Three kinds of virulence factors were detected on the chromosome of 
SA2107, including genes encoding toxins, exoenzyme, and immune-modulating 
protein. Notably, the three prophages harbored by the chromosome of SA2107 all 
carried virulence genes.
CONCLUSION: Thus far, only three complete genomes available for ST45-SCCmec IVa 
(2B)-t116 strain from United States, Germany, and Australia, respectively. The 
strain SA2107 was the first complete genome data (CP104559) from China for 
ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 MRSA.

Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes global outbreaks of foodborne disease. The 
main source of Salmonella for humans is animal-borne foods; however, the 
monitoring of Salmonella in the food chain via genomic platforms was limited in 
China. This study evaluated the prevalence, resistome, and virulome diversity of 
Salmonella strains identified from pork, retail environment, aquatic products, 
and poultry eggs of retail markets in Yichun city, Jiangxi province. The overall 
incidence of Salmonella was 9.4 %, with a higher contamination rate observed in 
pork at 13.5 %, followed by the retail environment at 7.69 %. The genomic 
analysis of the isolates revealed a total of fifteen distinct serovars, with 
serovar Enteritidis being the most prevalent (64.3 %). The phenotypic resistance 
analysis conducted by the broth microdilution method, revealed that 81.12 % of 
the isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), with high resistance to 
trimethoprim/sulphonamides (100 %), followed by tetracycline (99.3 %) and 
streptomycin (99.3 %). Genotypic analysis of antimicrobial resistance identified 
80 antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs), with mdf(A), aph(3')-Ib, tet(A), 
dfrA12, floR, bla TEM-1B , qnrS3, and sul2, conferring resistance to different 
antimicrobial classes, being the predominant ARGs. Additionally, forty ESBL 
genes, particularly critical genes such as bla CTX-M and bla NDM-1, were also 
identified in Salmonella isolates. The IncR, IncFIB (K), and IncX1 plasmid 
replicons were widely prevalent and served as significant reservoirs of 
horizontally acquired foreign genes. Moreover, key virulence genes such as cdtB, 
lpf and sef were also detected, in addition to Salmonella pathogenicity islands 
SPI-1 and SPI-2. This study reveals the prevalence of multidrug-resistant and 
virulent strains of Salmonella serovars in the markets of Yichuan city, posing a 
risk of human infections. The gained knowledge provided essential baseline 
information that may be utilized for regular tracking of MDR Salmonella 
transmission in the food chain to minimize potential future outbreaks.

Salmonella is a significant avian pathogen causing infectious diseases in 
poultry, with hatching playing a crucial role in its transmission. Despite its 
importance, systematic research on Salmonella transmission in hatcheries remains 
limited. This study evaluates the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of 
Salmonella throughout all production stages in yellow-feathered broiler 
hatcheries: laying, egg storage, incubating, hatching, and post-hatch. We found 
an overall Salmonella prevalence of 11.3 %, with the pathogen detected in both 
chickens and environmental samples. The hatching stage was identified as the 
most critical for Salmonella spread. Moreover, Salmonella Pullorum is the 
predominant serotype (93.97 %). Notably, all Salmonella isolates exhibited 
multidrug resistance, with some resistant to polymyxin B (22.41 %) and 
tigecycline (12.93 %). Resistance rates were highest for nalidixic acid (100.00 
%), sulfamethoxazole (100.00 %), ciprofloxacin (95.69 %), and ampicillin (94.83 
%). Additionally, antimicrobial resistance plasmid replicons and virulence genes 
were identified in these isolates. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 43 
S. Pullorum isolates, revealing that the majority were ST92 (90.70 %). 
Phylogenetic analysis classified the isolates into three lineages, with Lineage 
III being the most predominant (83.72 %). It was found that Salmonella isolates 
from chicks and eggs across various production stages were closely related, and 
those from the environment also showed significant similarity. This suggests 
that Salmonella in the environment may originate from chicks/eggs and spread to 
other stages. More attention should be paid to Salmonella contamination in 
yellow-feathered broiler hatcheries, and stringent measures should be taken to 
control the horizontal spread of Salmonella, in addition to blocking the pathway 
of vertical transmission.

OBJECTIVE: Raoultella planticola is an emerging opportunistic pathogen closely 
related to members of the Klebsiella genus. Genomic characterization of R. 
planticola isolates recovered from food animals is lacking. Here we describe the 
antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence factors, plasmid replicons, and 
phylogeny of three antimicrobial-resistant R. planticola isolates recovered from 
the feces of three dairy calves within 48 hours of birth.
METHODS: The genomes of the three R. planticola isolates were sequenced on a 
NextSeq 2000 platform using paired-end sequencing. The raw reads were trimmed 
using Trimmomatic and assembled using SPAdes v 3.15.4. Antimicrobial resistance 
genes, virulence factors and plasmid replicons were identified using ABRicate. 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified among the genomes using the 
Harvest package and phylogenies were inferred using RAxML.
RESULTS: In total, nine different ARGs known to confer resistance to at least 
five different classes of antibiotics were detected among the three R. 
planticola genomes. These include blaPLA, a β-lactamase found only in R. 
planticola, fosfomycin resistance gene fosA, and a sequence aligned with oxqAB, 
an efflux pump conferring resistance to antibiotics including fluoroquinolones. 
Each genome encoded between four and seven ARGs, with three considered 
genotypically to be multidrug-resistant (MDR). Two of the three genomes harbored 
plasmids, and all three encoded 41 to 42 virulence factors, including iron 
scavenging genes sitABCD.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrate the presence of diverse 
antimicrobial-resistant R. planticola, isolated from the feces of healthy dairy 
calves, that had some virulence factors that may cause human disease.

The plasmid-borne resistance gene mcr drastically undermines the effectiveness 
of colistin, posing a substantial threat to public health. Although several key 
plasmid elements that balance mcr-1 persistence and bacterial growth are 
identified, the regulatory interactions between mcr-1 and host bacteria remain 
poorly understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi crRNA library, it is identified 
that DNA polymerase IV, dinB, is essential for controlling the fitness cost 
associated with mcr-1 in Escherichia coli. The absence of dinB operon enhances 
mcr-1-mediated colistin resistance but simultaneously compromises bacterial 
growth and competitiveness. Meanwhile, dinB deficiency mitigates inflammatory 
response in RAW267.4 cells and enhances bacterial colonization in murine 
tissues. Further investigation reveals that mcr-1 actively upregulates dinB 
expression, with the increased reactive oxygen species induced by mcr-1 being 
crucial for this activation.   These findings suggest that dinB modulates mcr 
expression and bacterial fitness via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. 
Leveraging this regulatory relationship, a Toxin-Intein is engineered under the 
control of dinB promoter to selectively target and kill mcr-positive E. coli 
both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the work uncovers a novel adaptive mechanism 
underlying mcr persistence and provides a precise antimicrobial strategy to 
combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Self-transmissible IncC plasmids rapidly spread multidrug resistance in many 
medically important pathogens worldwide. A large plasmid of this type (pIP1202, 
~80 Kb) has been isolated in a clinical isolate of Yersinia pestis, the agent of 
plague. Here, we report that pIP1202 was highly stable in Y. pestis-infected 
mice and fleas and did not reduce Y. pestis virulence in these animals. Although 
pIP1202 inflicted a fitness cost in fleas (but not in mice) when the insects fed 
on blood containing a mixture of plasmid-free and plasmid-bearing strains, such 
a co-infection scenario has never been reported in nature, indicating that 
pIP1202 could persist in Y. pestis strains. Despite being resistant to commonly 
used antibiotic treatments, we show that plague caused by Y. pestis harboring 
the pIP1202 plasmid is effectively cured by LPC-233-a potent inhibitor of the 
essential LpxC enzyme in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway. Taken as a whole, our 
data highlight the alarming threat posed by Y. pestis harboring 
multidrug-resistant IncC plasmids that may persist in wild animals as a 
reservoir for long periods without antibiotic pressure and illuminate the impact 
of antibiotics with a novel mode of action against such a biothreat.

BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile is a significant cause of 
healthcare-associated infections, with rising antimicrobial resistance 
complicating treatment. This study offers a genomic analysis of C. difficile, 
focusing on sequence types (STs), global distribution, antibiotic resistance 
genes, and virulence factors in its chromosomal and plasmid DNA.
METHODS: A total of 19,711 C. difficile genomes were retrieved from GenBank. 
Prokka was used for genome annotation, and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) 
identified STs. Pan-genome analysis with Roary identified core and accessory 
genes. Antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, and toxins were detected 
using the CARD and VFDB databases, and the ABRicate software. Statistical 
analyses and visualizations were performed in R.
RESULTS: Among 366 identified STs, ST1 (1,326 isolates), ST2 (1,141), ST11 
(893), and ST42 (763) were predominant. Trends of genome streamlining included 
reductions in chromosomal length, gene count, protein-coding genes, and 
pseudogenes. Common antibiotic resistance genes-cdeA (99.46%), cplR (99.63%), 
and nimB (99.67%)-were nearly ubiquitous. Rare resistance genes like blaCTX-M-2, 
cfxA3, and blaZ appeared in only 0.005% of genomes. Vancomycin 
susceptibility-reducing vanG cluster genes were detected at low frequencies. 
Virulence factors showed variability, with highly prevalent genes such as zmp1 
(99.62%), groEL (99.60%), and rpoB/rpoB2 (99.60%). Moderately distributed genes 
included cwp66 (54.61%) and slpA (79.02%). Toxin genes tcdE (91.26%), tcdC 
(89.67%), and tcdB (89.06%) were widespread, while binary toxin genes cdtA 
(26.19%) and cdtB (26.26%) were less common. Toxin gene prevalence, particularly 
tcdA and tcdB, showed a gradual decline over time, with sharper reductions for 
cdtA and cdtB. Gene presence patterns (GPP-1) for resistance, virulence, and 
toxin genes were primarily linked to ST2, ST42, and ST8.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights C. difficile's adaptability and genetic 
diversity. The decline in toxin genes reflects fewer toxigenic isolates, but the 
bacterium's increasing preserved resistance factors and virulence genes enable 
its rapid evolution. ST2, ST42, and ST8 dominate globally, emphasizing the need 
for ongoing monitoring.

International travel facilitates the acquisition and carriage of 
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E). We 
describe genomes of predominant ESBL-E clones detected before and after travel 
among subjects departing from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during 2015-2021, and 
genomes publicly available from countries visited by travelers. WGS (Illumina 
NovaSeq) was performed on 70 ESBL-E isolates from 66 travelers (18 pre- and 52 
post-travel). Sequence type (ST), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence 
genes, and plasmids were determined by Center for Genomic Epidemiology tools. 
Phylogenetic trees were constructed with each of the most frequent ST of 
travelers' genomes (TG) and genomes with the same ST from Enterobase (EG). Other 
analyses were performed with Prokka, Roary, SNP-sites, and FastTree. Trees were 
visualized with iTOL. Among 70 ESBL-E, the clonal composition was quite diverse, 
with 41 different ST, with predominance before of CC10 and CC131, and after 
travel, CC10, CC131, CC69, and CC38, and three ST described for the first time: 
ST14408 and ST14412 (CC10), and ST4411 (CC20). Core genome phylogenetic analysis 
revealed 17 clusters, eight of which formed by post-travel TG and EG detected in 
the same country visited by traveler. We observed an increased number and 
diversity of AMR genes, plasmids, and virulence genes in post-travel isolates, 
although we only found statistical significance for IncFIB plasmid. Genome 
clustering supported the high-risk clone acquisition and AMR during 
international trips. More than half of detected clones were related to ExPEC and 
showed an increased number and diversity of AMR and virulence-related genes, as 
well as plasmids in post-travel isolates.

In July 2023, panicle and leaf blight-like symptoms were observed from the rice 
(Oryza sativa) variety, PVL03, in research field plots in Louisiana (Rayne, LA 
70578, USA; 30.21330⁰ N, 92.37309⁰ W). We observed that chlorosis started on the 
tips and spread throughout the whole leaf. We also observed panicle blight-like 
symptoms (grain discoloration of rice hulls) on infected rice plants at the 
heading stage, which ranged from dark brown to black. Disease incidences were 
approximately 70% in the observed plots. Five plants were sampled from five 
plots (one plant per plot). Leaf tissues including both symptomatic and healthy 
parts (~ 1 cm2) were surfaced sterilized and placed on CCNT medium, a 
semi-selective medium for the rice bacterial panicle blight pathogen 
Burkholderia glumae (Kawaradani et al., 2000), and on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar 
supplemented with cycloheximide (50 µg/ml) for non-selective isolation of 
bacteria. For the panicle samples, the surfaced sterilized rice kernels were 
dehulled and ground in sterile distilled H2O using a sterile mortar and pestle. 
The homogenate was spread on the CCNT media and LB agar supplemented with 
nitrofurantoin (50 µg/ml) and cycloheximide (50 µg/ml). After ~72 h at 41⁰C, 
round, smooth and yellow-colored bacterial colonies were observed on both media. 
The two isolates, one from an infected rice leaf (LPL-1) and the other from the 
infected rice panicles (LPP-1), were initially identified as Pantoea ananatis 
based on PCR-amplified 16S rDNA sequences (Weisburg et al., 1991). The taxonomic 
identity of these two isolates was further confirmed through whole genome 
sequencing (NCBI Accession ID: PRJNA1092676), which was performed through a 
hybrid sequencing approach using Oxford Nanopore sequencer & Illumina 
NextSeq2000 system (Plasmidsaurus Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA). To 
satisfy Koch's postulates, we inoculated six one-month-old rice plants (cv. 
Kitaake) with LPL-1 and LPP-1, respectively, by pricking the stems with a 
sterile toothpick touched to the overnight grown bacterial culture on LB agar (~ 
5-8 x 105 bacterial cells). This virulence assay was conducted twice, and rice 
plants inoculated with sterile distilled water were included as the negative 
control. By 27 days post inoculation (DPI), the inoculated plants developed 
symptoms on leaves and panicles, which were like the symptoms originally 
observed in the field, and additional symptoms such as shot holes and stem 
necrosis were also observed. From leaf and panicle samples of the artificially 
inoculated plants, we reisolated bacteria and confirmed the identity of the 
bacteria using the P. ananatis specific PCR primers PANA_1080 61F and PANA_1080 
1009R (Asselin et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
report of bacterial panicle and leaf blight of rice caused by P. ananatis in 
Louisiana. Since P. ananatis is a recently emerging pathogen of rice worldwide, 
including the United States (Yu et. al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Luna et al., 
2023), it is crucial to monitor the occurrence of this pathogen in other 
rice-growing areas as a potential threat to US rice production.

Protozoa, as primary predators of soil bacteria, represent an overlooked natural 
driver in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. However, the effects 
of protozoan predation on antibiotic resistance genes dissemination at the 
community level, along with the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Here we 
used fluorescence-activated cell sorting, qPCR, combined with metagenomics and 
reverse transcription quantitative PCR, to unveil how protozoa (Colpoda steinii 
and Acanthamoeba castellanii) influence the plasmid-mediated transfer of 
antibiotic resistance genes to soil microbial communities. Protozoan predation 
reduced the absolute abundance of plasmids but promoted the expression of 
conjugation-associated genes, leading to a 5-fold and 4.5-fold increase in 
conjugation frequency in the presence of C. steinii and A. castellanii, 
respectively. Excessive oxidative stress, increased membrane permeability, and 
the provoked SOS response closely associated with the increased conjugative 
transfer. Protozoan predation also altered the plasmid host range and selected 
for specific transconjugant taxa along with antibiotic resistance genes and 
virulence factors carried by transconjugant communities. This study underscores 
the role of protozoa in the plasmid-mediated conjugative transfer of antibiotic 
resistance genes, providing new insights into microbial mechanisms that drive 
the dissemination of environmental antibiotic resistance.

Following a period of disuse owing to the emergence of multidrug-resistant 
Gram-negative bacteria, colistin has regained global attention as an antibiotic 
of last resort. The resurgence in its utilization has led to a concurrent 
increase in acquired resistance, presenting a significant challenge in clinical 
treatment. Predominantly, resistance mechanisms involve alterations in the lipid 
A component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure. These alterations are 
facilitated by the addition of cationic phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) or 
4-amino-L-arabinose, often driven by the upregulation of two-component 
regulatory systems such as PmrAB and PhoPQ. Structural components of bacteria, 
such as capsules and efflux pumps, can also play an important role in the 
resistance mechanism. In addition to these biochemical modifications, structural 
components of bacteria like capsules and efflux pumps also play crucial roles in 
mediating resistance. Another significant mechanism is the acquisition of the 
plasmid-mediated mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) gene, which poses a global 
health threat due to its ability to transfer between different bacterial genera. 
Contemporary strategies to combat colistin resistance include the development 
and use of novel drugs and inhibitors. To devise effective interventions, it is 
imperative to first elucidate the precise mechanisms of colistin resistance and 
determine the roles of various contributing factors.

The global dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae pathotypes with 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent traits poses a threat to public 
health. The situation in Armenia is unclear, and we performed a comprehensive 
characterisation of 48 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae, collected from 2018 
to 2024. The majority of the isolates (64.58%) were extensively drug-resistant 
(XDR) and MDR. Genomic analysis of 21 isolates revealed the presence of 
international high-risk MDR clones (ST395, ST15, and ST307). The ST395 strains 
were isolated from children and resisted the first-line drugs such as 
beta-lactams. These isolates harboured a range of virulence determinants, from 
capsule polysaccharides to siderophores to regulators of the mucoid phenotype. 
The ST395 strains are enriched by ICEs, plasmids, and prophages, on which 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes are located and which may 
lead to the convergence of MDR and hypervirulent traits. There is a widespread 
non-specific AMR mechanism among our K. pneumoniae strains. These are mutations 
in the porin genes, which reduce permeability to antimicrobials, and mutations 
in the regulators of efflux pumps, which lead to overexpression of drug efflux 
pumps such as AcrAB. These mechanisms may contribute to the elevated MICs and 
confer AMR to strains with no specific AMR genes.

Campylobacter is one of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis 
worldwide. It frequently contaminates poultry and other raw meat products, which 
are the primary sources of Campylobacter infections in humans. Plasmids, known 
as important mobile genetic elements, often carry genes for antibiotic 
resistance, virulence, and self-mobilization. They serve as the main vectors for 
transferring genetic material and spreading resistance and virulence among 
bacteria. In this study, we identified 34 new plasmids from 43 C. jejuni and C. 
coli strains isolated from retail meat using long-read and short-read genome 
sequencing. Pangenomic analysis of the plasmid assemblies and reference plasmids 
from GenBank revealed five distinct groups, namely, pTet, pVir, mega plasmids 
(>80 kb), mid plasmids (~30 kb), and small plasmids (<6 kb). Pangenomic analysis 
identified the core and accessory genes in each group, indicating a high degree 
of genetic similarity within groups and substantial diversity between the 
groups. The pTet plasmids were linked to tetracycline resistance phenotypes in 
host strains. The mega plasmids carry multiple genes (e.g., aph(3')-III, type IV 
and VI secretion systems, and type II toxin-antitoxin systems) important for 
plasmid mobilization, virulence, antibiotic resistance, and the persistence of 
Campylobacter. Together, the identification and comprehensive genetic 
characterization of new plasmids from Campylobacter food isolates contributes to 
understanding the mechanisms of gene transfer, particularly the spread of 
genetic determinants of virulence and antibiotic resistance in this important 
pathogen.

The emergence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in food products is a 
growing concern due to the potential transfer of resistance to human pathogens. 
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of colistin-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae in raw and ready-to-eat food samples collected from two 
regions of Italy (Apulia and Basilicata) and to evaluate their resistance 
phenotypes and genetic characteristics. A total of 1000 food samples were 
screened, with a prevalence of 4.4% of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. 
The majority of the isolates belonged to Enterobacter spp. (60%), followed by 
Moellerella wisconsensis, Atlantibacter hermannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 
Escherichia coli, among others. Genomic sequencing and antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing revealed high levels of resistance to β-lactams, with 
most isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). Notably, seven isolates 
harbored mcr genes (mcr-1, mcr-9, and mcr-10). Additionally, in four of them 
were predicted the IncHI2 plasmids, known to facilitate the spread of colistin 
resistance. Furthermore, 56 antimicrobial resistance genes were identified, 
suggesting the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance to several antibiotic 
classes. Virulence gene analysis showed that E. coli and other isolates carried 
genes linked to pathogenicity, increasing the potential risk to public health. 
This study emphasizes the role of food as a potential reservoir for 
colistin-resistant bacteria and the importance of monitoring the spread of AMR 
genes in foodborne pathogens.

The global incidence of Salmonella enterica serovar Schwarzengrund has risen in 
recent years. This serotype has been isolated from poultry, retail meat, and 
other food products, leading to multiple outbreaks. Alongside the increase in 
infections, there are growing concerns about the increasing levels of 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among S. Schwarzengrund strains. This study aims 
to better understand the genetic factors possibly contributing to the rising 
prevalence of S. Schwarzengrund by analyzing the sequences of 2058 isolates from 
both human patients (N = 313) and food- and animal-associated sources, including 
chicken (N = 1145), turkey (N = 300), pork (N = 132), and other sources (N = 
168). Data were obtained from GenBank and analyzed for AMR genes using 
AMRFinder. Additionally, putative virulence genes and plasmid transfer genes 
were assessed using the Virulence and AMR Plasmid Transfer Factor Database. AMR 
genes were found in 1269 (61.7%) of the isolates, with a total of 2478 AMR genes 
among the isolates, the most common being aph(3″)-Ib (N = 969, 47.1%), tet(A) (N 
= 190, 9.2%), and sul2 (N = 150, 7.3%), which are responsible for resistance to 
aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide, respectively. Additionally, 1060 
(51.5%) isolates carried multiple plasmid transfer genes associated with 
IncFIB-FIC(FII) plasmids. Other plasmid types found in at least 1% of the 
strains included IncI1 (N = 101, 4.9%), IncHI2 (N = 62, 3.0%), or IncHI1 (N = 
24, 1.2%). The virulence gene profiles of human isolates showed diversity but 
largely overlapped with those from different food sources. Notably, the 
aerobactin iron acquisition genes, associated with Salmonella's virulence and 
colonization, were highly prevalent among chicken isolates (N = 1019, 89.0%) but 
less frequent in isolates from other sources (N = 65, 7.2%). IncFIB-FIC(FII) 
plasmids, commonly harboring the aerobactin operon, were highly prevalent among 
chicken-related isolates and present in about 10% of human isolates. The diverse 
plasmid, AMR, and virulence gene profiles in human-associated isolates suggest 
that multiple factors may contribute to the increased virulence in S. 
Schwarzengrund.

Klebsiella pneumoniae represent a common invasive infection etiological agent, 
whose potential carbapenem-resistance and hypermucoviscosity complicate the 
patient's management. Infection development often derives from gastrointestinal 
colonization; thus, it is fundamental to monitor asymptomatic K. pneumoniae 
colonization through surveillance protocols, especially for intensive care and 
immunocompromised patients. We described a six-month routine screening protocol 
from the Policlinico of Catania (Italy), while blood samples were collected from 
the same patients only in cases of a systemic infection suspicion. All the 
patients who had dissemination episodes were furtherly investigated through 
next-generation sequencing, analyzing both colonizing and disseminating strains. 
This study documents emerging invasive sequence types such as ST101, ST307, and 
ST395, mainly revealing blaNDM or blaKPC genes, along with siderophores and 
hyperproduction capsule markers as virulence factors. Most of the detected 
factors are presumably related to a specific plasmid content, which are 
extremely varied and rich. In conclusion, active surveillance through sequencing 
is essential to enhance awareness of local epidemiology within high-risk 
multi-drug resistance areas. A random sequencing analysis on the most warning 
microorganisms could enhance sequence typing (ST) awareness within specific 
settings, allowing for better prevention control strategies on their eventual 
persistence or diffusion.

Acinetobacter baumannii is considered one of the prioritized ESKAPE 
microorganisms for the research and development of novel treatments by the World 
Health Organization, especially because of its remarkable persistence and drug 
resistance. In this review, we describe how this can be acquired by the 
enzymatic degradation of antibiotics, target site modification, altered membrane 
permeability, multidrug efflux pumps, and their ability to form biofilms. Also, 
the evolution of drug resistance in A. baumannii, which is mainly driven by 
mobile genetic elements, is reported, with particular reference to 
plasmid-associated resistance, resistance islands, and insertion sequences. 
Finally, an overview of existing, new, and alternative therapies is provided.

Background/Objectives: Infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR)bacteria 
pose a significant public health threat by worsening patient outcomes, 
contributing to hospital outbreaks, and increasing health and economic burdens. 
Advanced genomic tools enhance the detection of resistance genes, virulence 
factors, and high-risk clones, thus improving the management of MDR infections. 
In the Autonomous Community of Aragon, the diversity and incidence of 
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have increased during the last 
years. This study analyses CPE trends at a tertiary hospital in Spain from 2021 
to 2023, aiming to optimize personalized medicine. Methods: CPE isolates were 
the first isolate per patient, year, species, and carbapenemase from January 
2021 to December 2023. Additional metadata were collected from the laboratory's 
information system. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by broth 
microdilution. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina short 
reads. De novo assembly was used to generate draft genomes in order to determine 
their complete taxonomic classification, resistome, plasmidome, sequence type 
(ST), core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), and phylogenetic 
relationships using a suite of bioinformatics tools and in-house scripts. 
Results: Between 2021 and 2023, 0.4% out of 38,145 Enterobacteriaceae isolates 
were CPE. The CPE rate tripled in 2022 and doubled again in 2023. The most 
common species was Klebsiella pneumoniae (51.8%) and the most common 
carbapenemase was blaOXA-48. WGS revealed concordant species identification and 
the carbapenemase distribution in detail. Resistance rates to critical 
antibiotics, such as carbapenems, were variable, but in most cases were above 
70%. Genetic diversity was observed in WGS and phylogenetic analyses, with 
plasmids often mediating carbapenemase dissemination. Conclusions: The 
increasing rate of CPE in healthcare settings highlights a critical public 
health challenge, with limited treatment options. Genomic characterization is 
essential to understanding resistance mechanisms, aiding therapy, limiting 
outbreaks, and improving precision medicine.

Ready-to-eat (RTE) foods are the most common sources of Listeria monocytogenes 
transmission. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) enhances the investigation of 
foodborne outbreaks by enabling the tracking of pathogen sources and the 
prediction of genetic traits related to virulence, stress, and antimicrobial 
resistance, which benefit food safety management. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the efficacy of WGS in the typing of 16 L. monocytogenes strains 
isolated from refrigerated foods in Chile, highlighting its advantages in 
pathogen identification and the improvement of epidemiological surveillance and 
food safety. Using cgMLST, a cluster was identified comprising 2 strains with 
zero allele differences among the 16 strains evaluated. Ninety-four percent of 
the isolates (15/16) were serotype 1/2b, and 88% of them (14/16) were ST5. All 
strains shared identical virulence genes related to adhesion (ami, iap, lapB), 
stress resistance (clpCEP), invasion (aut, iapcwhA, inlAB, lpeA), toxin 
production (hly), and intracellular regulation (prfA), with only 13 strains 
exhibiting the bcrBC and qacJ gene, which confer resistance to quaternary 
ammonium. The pCFSAN010068_01 plasmids were prevalent, and insertion sequences 
(ISLs) and composite transposons (cns) were detected in 87.5% of the strains. 
The presence of various antibiotic resistance genes, along with resistance to 
thermal shocks and disinfectants, may provide L. monocytogenes ST5 strains with 
enhanced environmental resistance to the hygiene treatments used in the studied 
food production plant.

OBJECTIVES: Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is a 
commonly reported pathogen which adapts to multiple hosts and causes critical 
disease burden at a global level. Here, we investigated a recently derived 
epidemic sublineage with multidrug resistance (MDR), which have caused extended 
time-period and cross-regional gastroenteritis outbreaks and even invasive 
nontyphoidal Salmonella disease (iNTS) in China.
METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) testing were 
applied to 729 Chinese S. Enteritidis isolates in relation to gastroenteritis 
outbreaks, gastrointestinal-sporadic and iNTS infections, spanning 28 years 
(1994-2021) in China. Phylogenomic analysis was performed to explore the 
population structure and evolutionary history of the Chinese isolates within a 
global context. Molecular investigations of AMR genes, virulence factors, mobile 
genetic elements and pan-genomes were also performed.
RESULTS: The Chinese S. Enteritidis collections exhibited a high level of 
multidrug resistance (MDR), including high resistance to nalidixic acid 
(97.67%). Notably, the multidrug resistance rate of iNTS strains has 
significantly increased over the past decade. Phylogenomic analysis showed that 
the majority of the Chinese isolates (98.63%) were distributed in the global 
pandemic lineage L1, while the other lineages were highly continent-specific. 
Particularly, the Chinese isolates were predominantly distributed in sublineages 
L1.2 (37.45%) and L1.3 (59.26%), forming two main Chinese clades (MCC1&2). The 
most recent common ancestor of MCC1&2 dated back to 1944 and 2004, respectively. 
The lineage L1, especially MCC1&2, harbored the most amount of AMR determinants 
and virulence genes, which was mainly due to the presence of a hybrid 
virulence-resistance plasmid and coexistence of different types of AMR plasmids 
in S. Enteritidis.
CONCLUSIONS: S. Enteritidis has evolved unique clonal clusters, MCC1&2, with 
critical MDR in China, which phylogenetically constitute an extension of the 
globally epidemic lineage and were characterized by distinct genetic traits. 
These clades have induced extensive outbreaks of gastroenteritis and serious 
cases of iNTS in China, underscoring the pressing nature and severity of this 
public health crisis. Implementing the One-Health strategy, longstanding routine 
surveillance and further genomic epidemiological studies are urgently required 
to capture epidemics, monitor changes in bacterial populations and determine the 
consequent risk to global public health.

The genome sequence of Pantoea agglomerans UADEC20 is presented, which is a 
strain isolated from agricultural fields in northeast Mexico. The genome was 
assembled into 13 scaffolds, constituting a total chromosome size of 4.2 Mbp, 
with two of the scaffolds representing closed plasmids. The strain exhibits 
activity in phosphate solubilization and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production and 
secretion; therefore, we explored its biotechnological potential via its genome 
sequencing and annotation. Genomic analyses showed that a total of 57 and 58 
coding sequences (CDSs) related to phosphate solubilization and EPS production 
were identified within its genome, in addition to a reduced number of CDSs 
related to drug resistance and phages. The comprehensive set of genes supporting 
phosphate solubilization, EPS synthesis, and secretion, along with its low 
virulence and antibiotic resistance levels, justify further research for its 
potential biotechnological application and possible use as a plant 
growth-promoting agent in the field. These findings suggest a unique genetic 
background in the P. agglomerans UADEC20 strain.

BACKGROUND: High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) participates in the progression of 
osteosarcoma (OS) through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
signaling pathway. Corylin, one of the active components of Psoralea corylifolia 
L., has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor effects. This study 
investigates the association between corylin and HMGB1, and their impact and 
mechanism of action on OS.
METHODS: OS cells and osteoblasts were transfected with/without HMGB1 
overexpression plasmid and siHMGB1. Cell viability was examined using the Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after treatment with corylin (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 30 
μM). The effects of corylin on cell malignant behaviors were examined by cell 
function assays. The mRNA expression level of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) 
was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR). The protein levels of HMGB1, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), 
MMP-9, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured by western blotting. 
The effects of corylin and HMGB1 on the expression of p38 MAPK signaling 
pathway-related proteins were also assessed.
RESULTS: Corylin decreased OS cell viability, proliferation, migration, and 
invasion but increased apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Corylin 
concentration-dependently suppressed the levels of HMGB1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and 
α-SMA. Overexpression of HMGB1 was partially reversed, while knockdown of HMGB1 
enhanced the above effects of corylin.
CONCLUSION: Corylin inhibits OS cell migration and invasion through regulation 
of the HMGB1-mediated p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

AbstractSalmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum is a pathogenic 
bacterium that causes fowl typhoid (FT), affecting chicken flocks worldwide. 
This study aimed to evaluate the emergence, dissemination and genomic profile of 
S. Gallinarum lineages from Brazil. Twelve whole-genomes sequences (WGS) of 
different S. Gallinarum strains isolated from Brazilian poultry farms (2014 to 
2018) were obtained and used to construct a dataset with other 31 previously 
published data (five more from Brazil). Brazilian strains phylogenetic 
diversity, temporal evolution and antimicrobial resistance/virulence genomic 
profile were evaluated. Sixteen (94.1%) Brazilian strains were from sequence 
type ST78 and one (5.9%) was from ST331. All S. Gallinarum strains clustered 
into five different clades/lineages (I to V), all circulating in South America 
and four (I, II, III, IV) in Brazil. The time of most recent common ancestor 
(tMRCA) of all strains was many centuries ago, but the lineages detected in 
South America (II and V) had tMRCA in recent decades. IncFIC(FII), IncFII(S) and 
ColRNAI were plasmid replicons frequently found in the lineages from Brazil, but 
antimicrobial resistance genes were scarce. Only two resistance genes 
(aac(6')-Iaa and mdf(A)) were detected in most strains, while other two 
(blaTEM-106 and fosA3) were present in some isolates. It was also observed 
important differences in the virulence genomic profile of the different 
lineages, highlighting lineage IV, which does not carry the very important 
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) genes cluster. In summary, this study 
reveals the emergence and dissemination of four different lineages of S. 
Gallinarum in Brazil.

The aquatic environment is a major pathway for the spread of antibiotic 
resistance (AR) among microorganisms. Among these, Klebsiella pneumoniae reveals 
high genome plasticity, adaptability, and the ability to colonize humans, 
animals, and the natural environment, awarding it a significant role in the 
spread of AR. This work presents an in-depth analysis of the whole sequences of 
149 K. pneumoniae genomes isolated from surface waters available in databases. 
The sequences were obtained from 20 countries in five continents. The analyses 
showed a high genomic diversity of isolates, classifying them into 94 unique 
sequence types. The isolates carried numerous virulence and drug resistance 
determinants in their genomes, including genes for carbapenem and colistin 
resistance. The critical resistance genes were located on plasmids, indicating 
their high mobility and ease of access in water environments. Sublineage 258 
members, in particular ST11, have been identified as important carriers of both 
important drug resistance determinants and key virulence factors, thus posing a 
substantial threat to human health. Our analysis revealed the direct 
transmission of drug-resistant and virulent clinical strains to the natural 
environment, highlighting the role of K. pneumoniae in the dissemination of drug 
resistance within the "One Health" framework. Surface waters represent an 
environment conducive to the spread and evolution of drug resistance, and K. 
pneumoniae plays a significant role in this process by providing 
clinically-significant antibiotic resistance genes to environmental recipients.

Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is currently one of the last resorts used to treat 
infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. However, KPC variants have become the main mechanism mediating CZA 
resistance in KPC-producing gram-negative bacteria after increasing the 
application of CZA. Our previous study revealed that CZA-resistant KPC-33 had 
emerged in carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) and had resulted in death 
due to hypervirulence and extensive drug resistance; however, the evolutionary 
path of KPC-33-producing CRPA has not been investigated. Here, we observed the 
emergence of blaKPC-33 in CRPA under drug pressure, leading to resistance to 
CZA. We further elucidated the pathway of resistance development due to blaKPC 
mutations in P. aeruginosa. Three KPC-producing P. aeruginosa (KPC-PA) strains 
(including one blaKPC-33-positive strain and two blaKPC-2-positive strains) were 
successively isolated from a hospitalized patient. The blaKPC-33-positive 
CZA-resistant strain SRPA0656 (CZA MIC >128 μg/mL, imipenem MIC = 32 μg/mL) was 
isolated after the blaKPC-2-positive P. aeruginosa SRP2863 (CZA MIC = 1 μg/mL, 
imipenem MIC >128 μg/mL) was treated with CZA. The subsequent use of carbapenems 
to treat the infection led to the re-emergence of the KPC-2-producing strain 
SRPA3703. Additionally, we collected four other KPC-33-producing P. aeruginosa 
strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all the 
KPC-33-bearing P. aeruginosa strains in this study were multidrug-resistant but 
susceptible to colistin and amikacin. Whole-genome sequencing indicated that 
blaKPC-33 was located on two Tn4401-like transposons contained in the plasmids 
and that most of these plasmids could be transferred into P. aeruginosa PAO1Rif 
isolates. Growth rate determination demonstrated that the relative growth rate 
of P. aeruginosa harboring blaKPC-33 was faster than that of P. aeruginosa 
harboring blaKPC-2 in the logarithmic phase. Global phylogenetic analysis 
revealed that most KPC-PA strains were isolated from China and the USA. MLST 
revealed that the most common ST in KPC-PA was ST463, which was detected only in 
China, and that all the strains carried blaKPC-2 or its derivatives. These 
results indicated that the use of CZA for the treatment of KPC-2-producing P. 
aeruginosa may have contributed to the evolution of KPC-33. The widespread 
dissemination of KPC-PA (especially the ST463) and Tn4401 transposons may 
increase the spread of CRPA isolates carrying blaKPC-33. Close attention to the 
development of resistance to CZA during clinical treatment of CRPA infection and 
monitoring CZA-resistant strains is necessary to prevent further spread.

The plasmid-mediated transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in complex 
microbiomes presents a significant global health challenge. This review examines 
recent technological advancements that have enabled us to move beyond the 
limitations of culture-dependent detection of conjugation and have enhanced our 
ability to track and understand the movement of ARGs in real-world scenarios. We 
critically assess the applications of single-cell sequencing, fluorescence-based 
techniques and advanced high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) 
approaches in elucidating plasmid-host interactions at unprecedented resolution. 
We also evaluate emerging techniques such as CRISPR-based phage engineering and 
discuss their potential for developing targeted strategies to curb ARG 
dissemination. Emerging data derived from these technologies have challenged our 
previous paradigms on plasmid-host compatibility and an awareness of an emerging 
uncharted realm for ARGs.
