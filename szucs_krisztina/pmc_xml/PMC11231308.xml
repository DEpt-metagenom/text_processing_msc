Global efforts are ongoing for improvement in early detection, prevention, and treatment. In this milieu, a comprehensive analysis of RNA-sequencing data of 1097 BRCA samples and 114 normal adjacent tissues is done to identify dysregulated genes in major molecular classes of BRCA in various clinical stages. Significantly enriched pathways in distinct molecular classes of BRCA have been identified. Pathways such as interferon signaling, tryptophan degradation, granulocyte adhesion &amp; diapedesis, and catecholamine biosynthesis were found to be significantly enriched in Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 negative, pathways such as RAR activation, adipogenesis, the role of JAK1/2 in interferon signaling, TGF-&#946; and STAT3 signaling intricated in Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor negative/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 positive and pathways as IL-1/IL-8, TNFR1/TNFR2, TWEAK, and relaxin signaling were found in triple-negative breast cancer. The dysregulated genes were clustered based on their mutation frequency which revealed nine mutated clusters, some of which were well characterized in cancer while others were less characterized. Each cluster was analyzed in detail which led to the identification of NLGN3, MAML2, TTN, SYNE1, ANK2 as candidate genes in BRCA. They are central hubs in the protein&#8211;protein-interaction network, indicating their important regulatory roles. Experimentally, the Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR and western blot confirmed our computational predictions in cell lines. Further, immunohistochemistry corroborated the results in&#8201;~&#8201;100 tissue samples. We could experimentally show that the NLGN3 &amp; ANK2 have tumor-suppressor roles in BRCA as shown by cell viability assay, transwell migration, colony forming and wound healing assay. The cell viability and migration was found to be significantly reduced in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines in which the selected genes were over-expressed as compared to control cell lines. The wound healing assay also demonstrated a significant decrease in wound closure at 12&#160;h and 24&#160;h time intervals in MCF7 &amp; MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings established the tumor suppressor roles of NLGN3 &amp; ANK2 in BRCA. This will have important ramifications for the therapeutics discovery against BRCA.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>TNBC</kwd><kwd>ER/PR+/HER-2&#8722;</kwd><kwd>ER/PR&#8722;/HER-2+</kwd><kwd>Hotnet2 clusters</kwd><kwd>Western Blot</kwd><kwd>Immunohistochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Oncology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">BRCA is the most common cancer in females. It has become the leading cause of cancer worldwide. As per the Cancer statistics 2022, about 51,400 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ of the female breast will be diagnosed. The new breast cancer cases rises to 297,790 and 2800 in female and male respectively as per the cancer statistics 2023. For women, breast cancer, colorectal cancers and lung cancer account for 52% of all new diagnoses, among which breast cancer alone accounts for 31% of female cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The late detection and emergence of resistance to existing therapy pose a significant challenge in the management of BRCA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, in-spite of recent advances in the understanding of the disease and the development of new therapies, the five-year survival rate is still unsatisfactory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, new targets are required for early detection and treatment to improve overall survival. In the present work, an in-depth analysis of RNA-sequencing data obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) for breast invasive carcinoma is reported. The dysregulated genes in three molecular classes of BRCA (ER/PR+/HER-2&#8722;; ER/PR&#8722;/HER-2+; triple negative) in the early and late stages have been identified. Further, different clusters of genes in various classes were investigated for their involvement in the biological processes. The subnetworks were found to contain frequently mutated genes in BRCA patients which can serve as therapeutic targets as well as biomarkers. The identified genes were further analyzed for their mutational patterns and effect on the overall survival of patients. The findings were finally validated by qRT-PCR, western blot in cell lines, and immunohistochemistry using&#8201;~&#8201;100 tissue samples. The tumor suppressor role was demonstrated by cell viability assay, transwell migration, colony-forming and wound healing assay in MCF7, MDA-MB-231 &amp; MCF10A cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p id="Par3">The differential expression analysis was done separately for each of the five classes viz. early stage ER/PR+/HER-2&#8722;, late stage ER/PR+/HER-2&#8722;, Early stage ER/PR&#8722;/HER-2+, early stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and late stage TNBC using tumor and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples.

It was interesting to see many genes in the identified clusters which are not yet reported to be directly involved in BRCA. Initial analysis indicated that these genes have reported interactions with known cancer genes. Some of them are regulators of genes having known role in BRCA. Additionally, many of them were also found to be dysregulated across other cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (Supplementary fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>).

The genes were further examined for mutations e.g. inframe, truncating, missense or others using cBioPortal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

SYNE is a protein that is found in the outer nuclear membrane which is comprised of N-terminal actin binding domain (ABD), a rod domain with variable spectrin repeats (SRs), and a KASH domain (KASH peptide and ONM (outer nuclear membrane) transmembrane domain) at C-terminal. At the ABD domain, SYNE 1/2 binds with actin and at the KASH peptide, it binds with SUN domain of SUN1/2 protein, forming a LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex. The N-terminal domain of SUN protein binds to nuclear lamina (LaminA). The LINC complex therefore links actin present in cytoplasm to nuclear lamina underlying the INM (inner nuclear membrane) and performs different cellular functions as (A) facilitates mechano-transduction, (B) formation of nuclear pore complex, (C) attaching centrosome to ONM D) provides stability and strength to cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>a) The functions of LINC complex in normal cells. b) The proposed role of nesprin 1 (SYNE1) in progression of breast invasive carcinoma.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO7" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41598_2024_59953_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">In the case of BRCA, there is a significant downregulation of SYNE1 protein as revealed by our analysis. This indicates that SYNE1 is less available to bind with SUN protein resulting in downregulation of LINC complex. Once the LINC complex is downregulated, the LaminA becomes free and its expression is upregulated. The LaminA has been reported to influence RhoA and its effector activity and acts as a negative regulator of ROCK2 protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. This suggests that as the LaminA is upregulated, the expression of ROCK2 gets down-regulated due to a negative feedback mechanism. The ROCK phosphorylates and activates PTEN which is a tumor suppressor gene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Therefore, when ROCK2 gets downregulated, PTEN is not able to get phosphorylated and remains inactive. PTEN is a phosphatase protein that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which is the product of PI3K into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The loss of PTEN function leads to the accumulation of PIP3 and enhanced activation of its subsequent downstream effectors as PDK1, AKT/PKB and CDK-cyclin. This eventually results in cell cycle progression, proliferation, cell survival and migration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">Understanding the molecular subtypes of breast cancer is important for predicting prognosis, guiding treatment decisions, and developing targeted therapies to improve outcomes for patients with breast cancer.

We found some interesting patterns e.g. genes which were upregulated in one molecular class, were downregulated in another class, and vice-versa. Additionally, some genes were found to be class specific. This difference might be due to differences in expression patterns of hormone receptors among the molecular classes. Significantly mutated subnetworks containing dysregulated, mutated and driver genes were also identified in different molecular classes of BRCA which gave insight into their biological functions. We believe that the dysregulated genes can serve as biomarkers for early detection of the class and stage of BRCA. Our approach seeks to maximize the use of datasets and techniques to understand the role of coding genes in disease pathogenesis, prognosis, and the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutics. We hope that identifying genes and their subnetworks will contribute to drug design and discovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec39"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
