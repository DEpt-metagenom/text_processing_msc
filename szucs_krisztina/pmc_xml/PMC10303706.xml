The current study sought to identify high-risk, &#8220;non-synonymous, single-nucleotide polymorphisms&#8221; (nsSNPs) in both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 to evaluate the role that these nsSNPs play in various types of cancer. We retrieved a total of 301 nsSNPs from various databases; 79 of these candidates constitute high-risk nsSNPs. Moreover, we identified eleven high-risk nsSNPs that cause various types of cancer: seven candidates for ANGPTL3 (L57H, F295L, L309F, K329M, R332L, S348C, and G409R) and four candidates for ANGPTL8 (P23L, R85W, R138S, and E148D). Protein&#8211;protein interaction analysis revealed a strong association of ANGPTL proteins with several tumor-suppressor proteins such as ITGB3, ITGAV, and RASSF5. &#8216;Gene-expression profiling interactive analysis&#8217; (GEPIA) showed that expression of ANGPTL3 is significantly downregulated in five cancers: sarcoma (SARC); cholangio carcinoma (CHOL); kidney chromophobe carcinoma (KICH); kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC); and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). GEPIA also showed that expression of ANGPTL8 remains downregulated in three cancers: CHOL; glioblastoma (GBM); and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). Survival rate analysis indicated that both upregulation and downregulation of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 leads to low survival rates in various types of cancer. Overall, the current study revealed that both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 constitute potential prognostic biomarkers for cancer; moreover, nsSNPs in these proteins might lead to the progression of cancer. However, further in vivo investigation will be helpful to validate the role of these proteins in the biology of cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>angiopoietin-like proteins</kwd><kwd>high-risk non-synonymous SNPs</kwd><kwd>protein structure and function</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Oujiang Laboratory</funding-source><award-id>OJQD2022005</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the science foundation of Oujiang Laboratory (OJQD2022005), Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-28-04648"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally after cardiovascular diseases. Approximately 19.3 million new cases and 10.0 million deaths were reported in 2020 [<xref rid="B1-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The global cancer burden is projected to increase to 28.4 million cases by 2040, a 47% increase from 2020, with a larger increase expected in developing (64% to 95%) versus developed (32% to 56%) countries. Notably, this may be further worsened by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy [<xref rid="B1-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several studies have been conducted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenesis to provide information for the development of new and effective strategies to diagnose and treat cancer. Currently, most cancer studies focus on understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and explore the role of a new class of matricellular proteins [<xref rid="B2-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Matricellular proteins are a group of extracellular matrix-associated glycoproteins secreted by cancer cells into the extracellular microenvironment. A recent study demonstrated that these secreted proteins can exacerbate cancer by promoting tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B3-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ANGPTLs are a family of glycoproteins composed of eight members, abbreviated as ANGPTL1&#8211;8 [<xref rid="B5-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ANGPTL proteins (1&#8211;7) resemble angiopoietins because both families of proteins share two structural domains at both the N-termini and C-termini (although ANGPTL8 constitutes an exception because it lacks a fibrinogen-like structure). Unlike angiopoietins, however, ANGPTLs cannot bind to receptor tyrosine kinases (Tie1 and Tie2) [<xref rid="B6-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, this difference suggests that ANGPTLs perform radically different biological functions from similarly structured angiopoietins. ANGPTL proteins have diverse functions and act like endocrine molecules on their corresponding receptor, but their target receptors and underlying functional mechanism(s) still remain largely deciphered [<xref rid="B7-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Studies have reported that ANGPTLs are involved in several biological processes, including lipid and glucose metabolisms and redox regulation. All ANGPTL proteins except ANGPTL1, ANGPTL5, and ANGPTL8 promote chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in cancer cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis [<xref rid="B2-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ANGPTL1 inhibits the function of fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus acting as a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="B8-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Integrin &#945;1&#946;1 acts as a receptor for ANGPTL1, and their interaction suppresses the phosphorylation of Src and FAK, which, in turn, inhibit the JAK-STAT3 pathway [<xref rid="B9-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous findings indicate that the high expression of ANGPTL2 in tumor cells can promote metastasis [<xref rid="B10-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The expression of ANGPTL3 is significantly upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where it triggers the ERK pathway and promotes cell proliferation [<xref rid="B11-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ANGPTL8, also known as lipasin or betatrophin, is a protein encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">C19orf80</italic> gene. This protein is a relatively novel and atypical member of the ANGPTL family; therefore, little is known about its role in diseases. However, its role is implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and renal dysfunction [<xref rid="B12-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p><p>The non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in proteins perturb their structure and function. nsSNPs are single-base changes leading to a change in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, and several of these variants are associated with disease [<xref rid="B13-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These nsSNPs can affect important biological pathways by disrupting protein&#8211;protein interaction [<xref rid="B15-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], inducing changes in protein conformation [<xref rid="B16-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or affecting the post-translational modification sites [<xref rid="B17-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As a result, nsSNPs are associated with complex diseases, including cancer. For instance, two SNPs (T266M and E40K) in ANGPTL4 affect triglyceride levels and are associated with cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients [<xref rid="B18-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, the SNP R59W in ANGPTL8 is associated with low cholesterol levels and also affects the cleavage of ANGPTL3 [<xref rid="B19-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Sun et al. reported an nsSNP at position 215 (S215R) in the P53 protein, which is a putative post-translational modification (PTM) site that has been associated with the development of breast cancer [<xref rid="B20-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. nsSNP mutations in oncoproteins are frequently observed in cancer, and an attempt to restore their functionality is a recent therapeutic strategy. Recent studies revealed that the utilization of in silico approaches for evaluating protein&#8211;protein interactions and analyzing SNPs provided evidence that mutations are associated with various disease conditions [<xref rid="B13-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>The current study was designed to identify high-risk nsSNPs, SNP-PTM sites, and SNPs located in ligand-binding sites in ANGPTL proteins. Further, protein&#8211;protein interaction analysis was conducted and the consequences of SNPs were predicted to investigate the potential role of these proteins in cancer (<xref rid="molecules-28-04648-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our findings indicate that ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 play a pivotal role in cancer progression by interacting with tumor-suppressor proteins such as ITGB3, ITGAV, RASSF5, and FNDC5. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-28-04648"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 are multifunctional secreted proteins commonly expressed in the liver and are regulated by several post-translational modifications (PTM). Previous findings revealed that ANGPTL3 plays a key role in various biological processes such as angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and tumorigenesis. ANGPTL8 is an atypical member of the angiopoietin-like protein family. This protein is associated with inflammation and metabolic syndromes, and was recently reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="B8-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The alignment of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 sequences exhibited 50% identity at the N-terminal. The structural conformation of a protein plays a critical role in executing its function; however, nsSNPs may perturb the conformations of proteins. Therefore, it is important to explore the effect of pathological nsSNPs on changes in the structure of protein and their association with various disorders. Recent predictions of nsSNPs in oncogenes from large datasets using bioinformatic investigation show their adverse effect on protein structure and function [<xref rid="B22-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study, we used integrated computational analysis to determine the high-risk SNPs and their effect on the structure and function of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 proteins. Four prediction tools (nsSNP analyzer, PROVEAN, SNP&amp;Go, and PMUT) were used to explore the pathological effect, and the SNPs predicted as pathological by at least three tools were considered high-risk SNPs. We identified 67 high-risk nsSNPs in ANGPTL3 and 12 nsSNPs in ANGPTL8. In ANGPTL3, seven high-risk SNPs coincided with PTM sites, of which five were identified in highly conserved sites, whereas two SNPs were located in the ligand-binding site. A previous study showed that protein function is upregulated or downregulated by several PTMs, such as the phosphorylation of LC3A, which downregulated its autophagic function, whereas dephosphorylation enhanced its autophagic function [<xref rid="B23-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, another study demonstrated that amino acid residue R68 found in the ligand-binding site in Atg8 is required for interaction with Atg4B [<xref rid="B24-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Protein structure, function, and regulation significantly depend on protein stability. A decrease in protein stability causes aggregation, degradation, and misfolding, which leads to the dysfunction of proteins. Protein stability change was determined to evaluate the effect of the predicted high-risk SNPs. Out of the 67 SNPs in ANGPTL3, 60 decreased protein stability and therefore may result in a dysfunctional protein. On the other hand, 10 out of 12 SNPs in ANGPTL8 were predicted to decrease protein stability. </p><p>The evolutionary conservation of a high-risk pathological SNP further increases the severity of a mutation. The SNPs that are located in highly conserved regions are likely to have severe pathological effects compared with those found in the variable regions. In ANGPTL3, out of 67 high-risk SNPs, 50 were located in highly conserved regions, and 5 were identified in PTM sites. A previous study reported a mutation T352 in BECNI1 located in a highly conserved region which modulated the autophagy mechanism and enhanced the interaction between the encoded protein and Bcl-2 [<xref rid="B25-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>NetSurfP offers evolutionary conservative data with solvent accessibility prediction. The tool is used to predict whether a residue is functional (buried) or structural (exposed) based on the position relative to the protein core or surface. In this study, 18 SNPs out of the 67 were identified as functional, whereas 49 were predicted to be structural residues in ANGPTL3. Six out of the twelve SNPs in ANGPTL8 were predicted to be functional residues. These results indicate that ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 contain several high-risk SNPs due to their high conservancy, functionality, and ability to decrease protein stability. Protein stability cannot be predicted based on a single factor. The physiochemical properties of residues such as hydrophobicity, charge, and polarity are also important factors in determining protein stability. Protein stability is associated with the presence of hydrophobic amino acids on the protein&#8217;s surface area, as these amino acids hinder water access to the core protein area. For instance, among the exposed SNPs, G54R introduces positive charges R (arginine) in place of neutral G (glycine), which causes the repulsion of a ligand or other residues with the same charge. As a result, this mutation may severely hamper the interaction between ANGPTL3 and other molecules. Similarly, the SNP S292P, mutant (proline) residue bigger than the wild-type (serine) residue causes bumps. In addition, the wild-type residue is hydrophobic and forms a H-bond with aspartic acid at position 292, whereas the mutant residue is not involved in H-bond formation and increases the hydrophobicity of the protein. This finding is consistent with a previous study which reported that mutation at position 292 (rs138899888) inhibits protein secretion associated with plasma triglyceride level [<xref rid="B26-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In ANGPTL8, the SNP at position 66, serine (S), is substituted with isoleucine (I). The mutation introduces a more hydrophobic residue at this position which results in the loss of hydrogen bonds and might disrupt correct protein folding. These results were verified through a HOPE analysis. The results from the HOPE tool showed that 49 high-risk SNPs in ANGPTL3 and 12 SNPs in ANGPTL8 have a deleterious effect on the protein structures (<xref rid="app1-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="app">Supplementary File S3</xref>). A PPI network is a critical parameter to understand the cellular processes associated with a protein. STRING is a tool used to evaluate and filter functional proteomic data which offers an intuitive program for determining the structural, functional, and evolutionary features of proteins. The PPI analysis revealed that ANGPTL3 interacts with integrin &#946;3 (ITGB3) and ITGAV. ITGB3 is a cell-adhesion receptor that plays a crucial role in the interaction between cells and extracellular fluid, and it proposed to be critical for cancer metastasis. </p><p>Protein docking analysis showed that 23 interface residues of ANGPTL3 interact with 23 residues of cancer-suppressing ITGB3 and ITGAV proteins. The interactions included H-bonds, salt bridges, and non-bonding interactions. The residue (Leu) at position 57 in ANGPTL3 interacts with the Asp688 of ITGB3 (<xref rid="app1-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>). The mutation at this position (L57H) was identified as a high-risk nsSNP and was predicted to cause kidney cancer. A study involving the Chinese Han population demonstrated that two SNPs (rs11137037 and rs12674822) in ANGPTL2 are associated with the progression of lung cancer [<xref rid="B27-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. ANGPTL8 was shown to interact with 24 and 12 residues of RASSF5 and FNDC5 proteins, respectively. RASSF5 is involved in a series of cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation, and the inactivation of RASSF5 has been implicated in oncogenesis. The overall tertiary structural consequences of these pathological SNPs were further evaluated through Phyre2 homology modeling. The wild-type and mutant protein structures were generated and the TM-align tool was used to determine the RMSD and TM score for the models. A lower TM score and higher RMSD values indicate a higher deviation of the mutant protein structure from the wild type. The TM alignment results revealed that the conformations of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 proteins were significantly different compared with the native protein. The number of cancer-causing high-risk SNPs was lower in ANGPTL8 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4) than in ANGPTL3 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7). However, more adverse effects were observed on the ANGPTL8 structure than in ANGPTL3 (<xref rid="app1-molecules-28-04648" ref-type="app">Figure S6</xref>). This can be attributed to the vast physiochemical differences in amino acids between wild-type and mutant proteins. The mutations in protein not only affect protein structure and function but also affect protein expressions, which may lead to disease conditions.</p><p>Gene expression analyses indicated that lower expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">ANGPTL3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C19orf80</italic> are associated with cancer.

Conclusions</title><p>The current study&#8217;s findings indicate that ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 proteins are tumor suppressors and are aberrantly expressed in various types of cancer. Mutations in these proteins are suggested to be associated with perturbed protein structure and function. A total of 79 high-risk nsSNPs were identified in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8; these are potentially pathological and decrease protein stability, suggesting their deleterious effect on protein structure. Further analysis showed seven high-risk SNPs (L57H, F295L, L309F, K329M, R332L, S348C, and G409R) in ANGPTL3 and four high-risk SNPs (P23L, R85W, R138S, and E148D) in ANGPTL8 associated with various types of cancer, including large intestine cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, skin cancer, and head and neck cancer. We believe that the comprehensive analysis of nsSNPs in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 represents a significant advancement in our understanding of these proteins and their role in cancer. By understanding the genetic basis of cancer, researchers and healthcare providers are in a better position to provide personalized cancer screening and prevention strategies. We hope the current study will serve as a benchmark for the development of potential diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions. However, a large-scale, population-based study should be conducted to validate the effect of these nsSNPs on the structure and function of the proteins and their associations with cancer. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
