This review aims to investigate the role of OPG expression in breast cancer. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed Medline, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Only full-text English publications from inception to September 2024 were included. Results: Studies have demonstrated that certain SNPs in the OPG gene, specifically <italic toggle="yes">rs3102735</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">rs2073618</italic>, are linked to a higher risk of breast cancer development. Additionally, OPG&#8217;s function as a TRAIL decoy receptor may inhibit the death of cancer cells. Furthermore, OPG in the serum and its interactions with BRCA mutations are being investigated for their potential influence on breast cancer progression. Studies have found that OPG promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and aneuploidy in normal mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, OPG mediates the tumor-promoting effects of interleukin-1 beta and may serve as a biomarker for breast cancer risk, particularly in BRCA1 mutation carriers, through its role in dysregulated RANK signaling. Lastly, the use of recombinant OPG in mouse models has been found to exert anti-tumor effects. Conclusions: In this review, the role of OPG in breast cancer is examined. OPG has a multifaceted role in breast cancer tumorigenesis and exerts its effects through genetic variations (SNPs), interactions with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and the modulation of the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment effects of angiogenesis, cell survival, and metastasis. Additionally, OPG&#8217;s dual role as a tumor suppressor and promoter serves as a possible therapeutic target to enhance apoptosis, limit bone metastasis, and modulate the tumor microenvironment. Whilst much is now known, further studies are necessary to fully delineate the role of OPG.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>osteoprotegerin</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>single nucleotide polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>TRAIL</kwd><kwd>RANK</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No funding was received to perform this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-17-00337"><title>1. Introduction to Cancer</title><p>The overall prevalence of cancer in the United States is projected to rise significantly in 2024, with an estimated 2,001,140 new cancer diagnoses among both men and women. For females, approximately 972,060 new cases are expected across all cancer types. Breast cancer remains the most prevalent, accounting for 310,720 cases, making it the leading cancer diagnosis among women [<xref rid="B1-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Breast cancer mortality decreased by 42% in 2021, primarily due to advancements in early detection through widespread mammography screening [<xref rid="B1-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite this progress, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women. These statistics highlight the importance of prognostic biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer. Prognostic biomarkers provide insights into tumor biology and enable earlier detection, patient stratification based on risk, and guidance for personalized treatment strategies.</p><p>Cancer therapy has evolved significantly over the years. Before the 1970s, it began with radiation therapy as a modality to treat cancer and evolved to chemotherapeutic agents such as nitrogen mustard gas, folate antagonists, and purine antimetabolites. These modalities demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness depending on cancer type, with chemotherapy particularly effective against rapidly dividing malignant cells. Between the 1970s and 2023, new treatment approaches emerged, including hormonal therapies targeting specific mutations, such as trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 receptor-positive breast cells. Additionally, advancements like immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic virus therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have further revolutionized cancer treatment [<xref rid="B2-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec2-cancers-17-00337"><title>2. Introduction to Osteoprotegerin</title><p>Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, is a glycoprotein expressed by the <italic toggle="yes">TNFRSF11B</italic> gene and is secreted by stromal and osteoblastic cells [<xref rid="B3-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Chromosome <italic toggle="yes">8q23-24</italic> encodes for OPG, which consists of 401 amino acids in the transmembrane form before it is cleaved to 380 amino acids, and its structure can be seen displayed below in <xref rid="cancers-17-00337-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> [<xref rid="B4-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. OPG has various physiological functions in the body, but it mainly plays a role in the bone metabolism pathway by preventing the binding of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B (RANK) ligands to RANK, inhibiting osteoclast maturation and differentiation by binding to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B ligands (RANKL) [<xref rid="B4-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>OPG is important in maintaining normal bone physiology since it is involved in bone remodeling by inhibiting osteoclast activity through the RANKL-RANK pathway, thereby maintaining bone density and preventing conditions like osteoporosis. It is considered bone-protective due to its ability to suppress bone resorption and increase bone mass. Various cells in the bone marrow, including osteoblasts, B cells, megakaryocytes, platelets, vascular endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells, express and secrete OPG [<xref rid="B4-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Beyond the skeleton, OPG is also expressed in tissues such as the heart, kidney, liver, and spleen. It also has been shown that OPG regulates vascular biology by interacting with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), preventing arterial calcification and atherosclerosis. Additionally, OPG modulates immunity by influencing B-cell development and regulatory T-cell function [<xref rid="B4-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The RANK ligand, a type two transmembrane protein, is produced by osteoblasts and activated T-cells in its membrane form, and metalloproteinases cleave it to its soluble form [<xref rid="B6-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The soluble form is neutralized by binding to OPG, which aids in maintaining a balance in bone metabolism by preventing excessive bone resorption through the binding of RANK/RANKL [<xref rid="B7-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The interaction between RANKL and RANK on osteoclastic cells induces a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors that are essential to bone resorption, such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) [<xref rid="B6-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RANK is expressed in various tissues and cells throughout the body, including osteoclasts, the mammary glands, and immune cells [<xref rid="B8-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a result, the interaction between RANK and RANKL serves multiple functions beyond bone remodeling, playing significant roles in mammary gland physiology and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B9-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>NF-&#954;B is a family of transcription factors that regulate many biological processes [<xref rid="B10-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. NF-&#954;B controls genes expressed in immune responses and inflammation and is also involved in cellular proliferation by the induction of anti-apoptotic genes. These genes are crucial in cancer where NF-&#954;B activity is dysregulated, leading to increased tumor cell survival [<xref rid="B11-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Osteoprotegerin (OPG) exhibits a dual role in tumorigenesis, acting both as a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the biological context. As a decoy for RANKL, OPG can inhibit RANK-mediated signaling, a pathway critical for osteoclast activation and, more broadly, for promoting tumor progression. <xref rid="cancers-17-00337-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> displays the OPG/RANK/RANKL pathways, which regulates bone remodeling through the activation of osteoclasts. OPG exhibits tumor-promoting effects, as seen with reduced OPG levels; the unchecked RANKL activity contributes to bone metastases and tumor progression and survival. Conversely, OPG&#8217;s interaction with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) complicates its role in tumorigenesis. Acting as a decoy receptor for TRAIL, OPG prevents TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which inadvertently promotes tumor cell survival. Beyond its interaction with TRAIL, OPG may enhance tumor progression by fostering angiogenesis, modulating the tumor microenvironment, and aiding immune evasion [<xref rid="B12-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) also binds to OPG [<xref rid="B4-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TRAIL plays a significant role in programmed cell death by binding to the death receptors (DR4 &amp; DR5) on the surface of targeted cells. Hence, it is crucial in the induction of apoptosis in selective cancer cells [<xref rid="B13-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The expression of OPG has been found to increase cancers, such as lung and breast cancer, through the numerous interactions of OPG with other TNF receptor families [<xref rid="B14-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-cancers-17-00337"><title>3. OPG/RANK/RANKL Pathway &amp; Cancer</title><p>An imbalance in the OPG/RANK/RANKL ratio can contribute to the progression of cancer, particularly cancer that metastasizes to the bone. According to prior studies, it has been established that RANKL is involved in the signaling of tumor initiation in cancers such as breast and prostate cancer through the activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF 6), which further activates NF-&#954;B [<xref rid="B8-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, whether OPG plays a role in tumorigenesis has yet to be fully understood, as it exhibits antitumorigenic effects by acting as a decoy receptor for RANK; by contrast, its TRAIL-induced signaling is rendered tumor-promoting [<xref rid="B15-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Bone metastasis progression occurs due to the formation of a favorable bone microenvironment that supports tumor cell survival [<xref rid="B17-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This happens through the secretion of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones by cancer cells [<xref rid="B16-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One significant hormone involved is parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which plays an important role in altering the expression of RANKL and OPG [<xref rid="B17-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to PTHrP, tumor cells can directly express RANKL, leading to osteolysis, and secrete other pro-osteoclastogenic factors such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), Interleukin (IL)-1&#945;, IL-6, IL-8, and prostaglandin E2, all of which further promote bone degradation and support tumor growth within the bone microenvironment [<xref rid="B16-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The RANKL-RANK-OPG system plays a critical role in osteoimmunology, particularly focusing on the interactions between bone and immune systems. OPG functions as a decoy receptor for RANKL, binding to it and preventing its interaction with RANK. This regulation is critical in modulating immune responses. By inhibiting RANKL, OPG can influence immune cell functions, including the differentiation and activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). This modulation helps balance immune activation and tolerance, particularly in contexts such as autoimmune diseases and conditions involving bone destruction. The system&#8217;s broader relevance is noted in various diseases including metastatic bone tumors, where the balance of RANKL, RANK, and OPG plays an important role in disease progression and immune modulation [<xref rid="B19-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>While the interaction between OPG and RANKL has been extensively studied in bone metabolism and tumorigenesis, several gaps persist in our understanding of how this pathway operates in the tumor microenvironment. It is evident that excess RANKL activity and deprivation of OPG enhance osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and create a favorable microenvironment for tumor invasion and growth [<xref rid="B20-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the role of OPG and RANKL expression within tumors requires further investigation, particularly in the context of breast cancer subtypes. Variations in expression levels may significantly impact tumor progression, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration, potentially shaping the tumor microenvironment. Exploring these dynamics could provide critical insights into the broader implications of the OPG-RANKL axis in cancer biology [<xref rid="B8-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>This review investigates the role of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, with a focus on understanding the effects of the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OPG-encoding gene (<italic toggle="yes">TNFRSF11B</italic>).

Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles published in English, with full-text availability, to ensure easier accessibility to studies, as most studies are published in English; however, this may have limited the scope of relevant studies, potentially overlooking regionally specific insights into OPG&#8217;s role in breast cancer. All types of studies, including preclinical trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, and reviews, were included. Studies were included if they specifically investigated any aspect with regard to the tumorigenesis of OPG, with a focus on tumorigenesis in breast cancer.

Breast Cancer</title><p>Breast cancer is a neoplastic transformation of normal breast cells to abnormal cancerous cells that develops in breast tissue. The uncontrollable growth of these abnormal cells in breast tissue causes the formation of a tumor in different compartments of the breast, commonly the ductal epithelium and breast lobules. A breast cancer is classified as invasive or non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer, depending upon whether the cancer cells have invaded into surrounding tissue or are confined to either the duct or lobule. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women, accounting for more than 1 in 10 new cancer diagnoses annually and is the second most common cause of cancer death among women worldwide [<xref rid="B21-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, accounting for an incidence of approximately 2.3 million new cases in 2022 alone among women [<xref rid="B22-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Invasive breast cancer represented approximately 11.7% of new cases in 2020 [<xref rid="B21-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

One theory suggests that OPG promotes tumor growth through pro-angiogenic effects.

OPG Protein Serum Levels &amp; Breast Cancer Subtypes</title><p>The relationship between OPG protein levels in serum and risk for development of breast cancer was investigated. OPG protein serum levels were found to have a contrasting role in breast cancer tumorigenesis based on the breast cancer subtype, namely ER-positive versus ER-negative breast cancer. In the Troms&#248; study by Vik et al., serum samples from 76 subjects in Norway that developed breast cancer were categorized into tertiles for serum levels of OPG: 0.46&#8211;2.78 ng/mL, 2.79&#8211;3.55 ng/mL, and 3.56&#8211;25.81 ng/mL, respectively [<xref rid="B32-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Women in the upper tertile of OPG had a 45% reduced risk of breast cancer compared to the lowest tertile [<xref rid="B32-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, a 76% relative risk reduction was observed with high levels of OPG in the subset of women &lt;60 years.</p><p>The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study found that women with higher OPG serum levels had an increased relative risk (1.93) of developing estrogen receptor-negative (ER&#8211;) breast cancer [<xref rid="B33-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This risk was observed across tertiles of OPG serum levels, with higher levels correlating with more ER&#8722; cancer cases [<xref rid="B33-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A modest risk reduction of 0.84 for patients with ER+ breast cancer was observed with high levels of OPG [<xref rid="B33-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Although the Vik et al. study did not stratify the risk of breast cancer relative to OPG levels according to ER status, it is likely that both studies are in agreement that low OPG serum levels are associated with reduced risk of ER+ breast cancer, whilst higher OPG serum levels are associated with increased risk of ER&#8722; breast cancer. Thus, the likelihood of the development of either ER+ or ER&#8722; breast cancer subtypes may be associated with OPG serum levels.</p><p>Overall, the presence of high OPG levels may increase the risk of ER-negative breast cancer while being protective against ER-positive breast cancer cases. The protective effect may stem from the antagonizing role that OPG plays in RANK signaling, which is crucial for mammary epithelial cell development and proliferation [<xref rid="B7-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B32-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By preventing the RANK/RANKL interaction as OPG binds to RANKL, the potential pro-proliferative effects of the RANK/RANK axis are limited in ER-positive cells. This provides a therapeutic opportunity for OPG or other analogues as preventative agents in at-risk individuals with hereditary or familial hormone-sensitive breast cancers. Additionally, combining their use with RANKL inhibitors such as denosumab may mitigate the risk of RANKL-driven tumorigenesis in ER-positive cases [<xref rid="B34-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. On the other hand, the association of increased risk of ER-negative breast cancer with high OPG levels may be linked to OPG&#8217;s role as a decoy receptor for TRAIL, and therefore inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptotic effects in neoplastic cells and enhancing the survival of ER-negative tumor cells [<xref rid="B33-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, a number of clinical opportunities arise that can be implemented to capitalize on the treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cases with high OPG levels, including targeting the OPG&#8211;TRAIL interaction through the development of TRAIL receptor agonists or inhibitors of OPG&#8211;TRAIL binding. A TRAIL receptor agonist would restore apoptosis in tumor cells and counteract tumor progression, particularly in aggressive cases such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot6-cancers-17-00337"><title>5.6.

Among these pathways, the RANKL/RANK and B-catenin pathways play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation [<xref rid="B43-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The RANKL/RANK pathway regulates the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells [<xref rid="B18-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, because NFkB is a crucial regulator of the immune response and cellular proliferation, any imbalance in this interaction may promote the development of breast cancer.</p><p>Another pathway is B-catenin, which is pivotal in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. B-catenin signaling with a wingless-related integration site (wnt) is involved in carcinogenesis and is also associated with tumor progression and metastasis [<xref rid="B44-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, OPG has been shown to inhibit the &#946;-catenin pathway in breast cancer cells, potentially offering a therapeutic target for controlling tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="sec7dot2-cancers-17-00337"><title>7.2. Protective Role of Stromal Fibroblasts in Breast Tumorigenesis</title><p>Normal breast tissue contains stromal fibroblasts, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and architecture of the organ. These fibroblasts play a protective role in carcinogenesis by inhibiting the growth of normal epithelium [<xref rid="B45-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, the secretion of OPG by these fibroblasts inhibits several key breast-related signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB). Inhibition of the interleukin 6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) epigenetic feedback loop by OPG prevents the maintenance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness features in breast cancer cells, which are essential for cancer progression and metastasis. However, studies have shown that fibroblasts derived from breast cancer cells exhibit less growth inhibitory capacity and actually enhance epithelial growth. In cancerous cells, OPG function has been linked to promoting tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B45-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec7dot3-cancers-17-00337"><title>7.3. Recombinant OPG in Mouse Models</title><p>Recombinant osteoprotegerin (rOPG) is a laboratory-engineered version of the normally occurring OPG and is formed by genetic recombination. rOPG has significant antitumor effects in breast cancer through several mechanisms and the use of mouse models and a variety of breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-20, has provided evidence supporting these effects. When these cells were injected with 0.1 &#956;g/mL of rOPG, an inhibitory effect on important signaling pathways was induced [<xref rid="B46-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>One of the key pathways affected is the B-catenin/wnt pathway, which is important in maintaining the stemness and invasiveness of breast cancer stem cells [<xref rid="B47-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Overall, these findings suggest that rOPG has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent in targeting breast cancer stem cells, particularly by modulating the &#946;-catenin/wnt signaling pathway by reducing the expression of the stemness markers which are essential for self-renewal of cancer cells.</p><p>Another report utilized a different cell line from a mouse model, 4T1.2Luc, alongside MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7. Similarly to human breast cell lines, 4T1.2Luc has been found to express RANK, thus providing a model for testing the anti-tumor effects of OPG. The role of the RANKL/RANK pathway in breast tumorigenesis is well established; the addition of RANKL to the cell line increased proliferation, whereas the addition of OPG plus RANKL decreased the growth rate of 4T1.2Luc cells to baseline levels [<xref rid="B48-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Additionally, the effect of rOPG on bone metastasis has been tested in five different mouse models of breast cancer; inhibition of skeletal metastases occurred when given therapeutically or as a preventative measure [<xref rid="B9-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8-cancers-17-00337"><title>8. OPG as a Biomarker</title><p>Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is emerging as a potential biomarker for breast cancer, particularly in relation to disease progression and prognosis. A study assessing overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) revealed that high OPG levels, along with elevated RANKL and progesterone, significantly increase the risk of breast cancer [<xref rid="B49-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Additionally, a trend has been observed linking RANKL expression to a more favorable prognosis for OS, suggesting that the RANKL/OPG pathway may play a crucial role in risk prediction for breast cancer patients. These findings highlight the pathway&#8217;s potential for improving current risk models and targeted prevention strategies by stratification of patients with high risk of progression. However, further investigation is still needed to establish whether these serum markers can be considered prognostic factors.</p><sec><title>Levels of Circulating OPG in Different Breast Cancer Subtypes</title><p>The EPIC study revealed that ER&#8722; breast cancer incidence is higher among individuals with elevated serum OPG levels (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value 0.003) [<xref rid="B33-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similarly, another study confirmed that OPG could serve as a biomarker, particularly for ER&#8722; breast cancer, as elevated circulating OPG levels have been observed in this subtype. By contrast, no such increase has been detected in ER+ breast cancer [<xref rid="B27-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In an EPIC cohort, Sarnik et al. reported that ER+ breast cancer is associated with increased levels of RANKL, rather than OPG, emphasizing different biomarker profiles for breast cancer subtypes [<xref rid="B50-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Circulating OPG levels could be beneficial in identifying at-risk patients. One study identified a 5.33-fold higher risk of developing breast cancer among women with a high ratio of serum RANKL/OPG [<xref rid="B42-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, Kiechl et al. found a five-fold increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women with elevated progesterone and RANKL levels, in parallel with changes in the RANK/OPG ratio [<xref rid="B50-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, in individuals with inherited <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> mutations, circulating serum OPG levels have been found to be lower. This suggests a potential link between OPG levels and genetic predisposition to breast cancer, highlighting its relevance as a biomarker in high-risk populations. Conversely, those with <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutations and high serum OPG levels have been found to have a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer [<xref rid="B51-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9-cancers-17-00337"><title>9. Therapeutic Opportunities Derived from Osteoprotegerin Pathway Modulations in Breast Cancer</title><p>The investigation into the OPG modulatory pathways that can exert alterations in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer in this review allows for the exploration of potential therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of breast cancer.</p><sec id="sec9dot1-cancers-17-00337"><title>9.1. Targeting the OPG/TRAIL Interaction</title><p>Firstly, the OPG/TRAIL interaction can be targeted, as OPG has been shown to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells, known as immortalized human T lymphocytes [<xref rid="B26-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, focusing on the development of agents that block the OPG protein from acting as a decoy receptor for the TRAIL receptor, and therefore disrupt the binding of OPG to TRAIL, can allow TRAIL to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells effectively [<xref rid="B27-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These include TRAIL receptor agonists, including agents such as dulanermin, which has been shown to have little activity in killing cancer cells alone. However, when combined with other synergistic drugs, it has demonstrated its increased activity in killing cancer cell lines, including ovarian and lung cancer [<xref rid="B52-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, combination treatment incorporating dulanermin with other synergistic agents may provide an effective therapeutic potential in the treatment of breast cancer, where TRAIL&#8217;s pro-apoptotic effects can be restored, and the agents can be used to selectively induce cancer cell death.</p><p>Although dulanermin&#8217;s efficacy has only been explored in preclinical studies, its usage in human clinical trials appears feasible given that the challenges with its implementation are addressed. Firstly, the drug delivery method needs to be addressed, as systemic TRAIL activation may also affect healthy non-neoplastic cells, resulting in adverse effects or other pharmacokinetic effects such as rapid serum clearance [<xref rid="B53-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, delivery through targeted delivery methods such as nanoparticles or tumor-specific ligands will prove vital for its effectiveness and success. Next, the presence of both RANKL and TRAIL simultaneously in vivo may counteract the effects of OPG&#8211;TRAIL- targeted therapies. Thus, addressing the factors that lead to this complex tumor microenvironment will be critical to ensure the success of TRAIL-based therapies [<xref rid="B55-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Previous studies, including a study conducted by Li et al., have demonstrated how xenograft models can mimic the tumor microenvironment, simulating both tumor progression and metastatic pathways and providing a robust platform to allow for testing targeted interventions such as TRAIL-based therapies [<xref rid="B56-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The mouse model used in the study was shown to successfully simulate the effects of different anesthetic agents on breast cancer development, deepening our understanding of breast cancer progression in the xenograft model [<xref rid="B56-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, future studies should capitalize on this opportunity to incorporate patient-derived xenograft models when testing the efficacy of TRAIL-therapies in disrupting the OPG/TRAIL interaction in tumor microenvironments that closely resemble human breast cancer. Other pre-clinical combination therapies can also be tested on this xenograft model, where large-scale clinical studies can investigate the effectiveness of therapies such as combined TRAIL receptor agonists alongside RANKL inhibitors to assess the optimal therapeutic regimens in the treatment of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec9dot2-cancers-17-00337"><title>9.2. Modulating the OPG/RANK/RANKL Pathway &amp; Recombinant OPG (rOPG)</title><p>The OPG/RANK/RANKL pathway also offers a potential target for breast cancer therapy. RANKL inhibitors can be integrated into a multidisciplinary treatment to disrupt the pro-tumorigenic effects mediated by the OPG/RANK/RANKL axis. RANKL inhibitors can be used to prevent the progression of breast cancers, especially in cases of bone metastases, where denosumab, an FDA-approved RANKL inhibitor, is already in use to treat bony metastases from malignancies [<xref rid="B57-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the RANK ligand and inhibits osteoclast activity, which may prove beneficial in breast cancer cases demonstrating dysregulated OPG/RANK/RANKL activity [<xref rid="B58-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Denosumab is administered subcutaneously and, in the setting of breast cancer, may play a role in both diminishing bone loss from antihormonal treatments and preventing skeletal-related complications in metastatic breast cancer [<xref rid="B58-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Additionally, rOPG has been investigated in preclinical studies on murine models and has been demonstrated to have a dual effect of reducing bone metastases and inhibiting breast cancer stem cell signaling through &#946;-catenin/wnt pathways [<xref rid="B59-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This provides the opportunity for exploring rOPG&#8217;s potential as a dual-action therapeutic in the treatment of breast cancer, where its mechanism of action involves blocking RANKL to reduce bone metastasis in breast cancer while also reducing the progression of breast cancer through targeting the &#946;-catenin/wnt pathway, inducing inhibition of cancer stem cell signaling.</p><p>In <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers, there is an increased risk for the development of breast cancer, conferred by the functional inactivation of the tumor suppressor role that the <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> gene plays. This mutation subsequently results in reduced or dysfunctional DNA repair and gene transcription regulation, leading to the tumorigenesis of many cancers, including breast cancer [<xref rid="B62-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This presents an opportunity for further combination therapy in breast cancer targeting both RANKL and progesterone in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers. RANKL inhibitors such as denosumab may be combined with hormone modulators such as progesterone antagonists or even inhibitors of RANK signaling, which may reduce mammary epithelial proliferation and counteract the elevated breast cancer development risk involved in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers [<xref rid="B67-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec9dot3-cancers-17-00337"><title>9.3. OPG-Targeted Antibody Therapy, Anti-Angiogenesis Approaches, &amp; SNP-Based Personalized Therapy</title><p>Potential therapies to combat OPG&#8217;s effects on promoting breast tumorigenesis may include OPG-targeted antibody therapy. Goswami et al.&#8217;s study has highlighted the role that OPG plays in promoting breast tumor proliferation and angiogenesis in invasive breast cancer [<xref rid="B30-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, the development of monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the effects of OPG activity in tumors can prove effective, thereby reducing its tumor-promoting effects in breast cancer. Preclinical studies have previously explored the effects of anti-OPG antibodies in murine models, highlighting the role that anti-OPG antibodies can play in developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) through promoting cell survival, pro-proliferative, and pro-migratory signaling. By administering a human anti-OPG therapeutic antibody (Ky3) in murine models, PAH was significantly reduced and reversed by diminishing pulmonary vascular remodeling in small pulmonary arterioles [<xref rid="B68-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This anti-angiogenic effect may also prove beneficial when combined with other anti-angiogenic approaches such as the use of bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody drug, that has shown efficacy in disrupting tumor vascularization in breast cancer [<xref rid="B69-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These anti-angiogenesis approaches, combined with direct anti-OPG antibody targeting, can be combined with existing chemotherapies or checkpoint inhibitors routinely used in the treatment of breast cancer for a synergistic therapeutic effect.</p><p>Lastly, this review has identified the presence of specific SNPs in the OPG gene, such as rs3102735 or rs2073618, which are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, providing the opportunity for SNP-based personalized therapy [<xref rid="B14-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Patients with specific SNP mutations can be screened and identified early in the breast cancer treatment journey to allow their stratification for therapies targeting the OPG/RANKL pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec10-cancers-17-00337"><title>10. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this review explores the role of osteoprotegerin in breast cancer pathogenesis. OPG has a multifaceted role in breast cancer tumorigenesis and exerts its effects through genetic variations (SNPs), interactions with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and modulation of pro-tumorigenic microenvironment effects of angiogenesis, cell survival and metastasis. These findings leverage the mechanisms and pathways identified and propose actionable therapeutic opportunities that can be applied in treating breast cancer. Future research should further elucidate OPG&#8217;s role and utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

OPG contains amino-terminal signal peptides and cysteine-rich tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-like domains, which are the key binding forces to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B (RANK). Additionally, OPG includes two death domain homologous regions of which the functions are currently not understood. A heparin binding domain limits the half-life of this molecule and serves as a basis for dimer formation [<xref rid="B5-cancers-17-00337" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="cancers-17-00337-g001.jpg"/></fig><fig position="float" id="cancers-17-00337-f002" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The OPG/RANK/RANKL pathway. A schematic to illustrate the OPG/RANK/RANKL pathway, which regulates bone remodeling by balancing osteoclast activation. The receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B ligand (RANKL) binds to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B (RANK) on osteoclast precursors, initiating a signaling cascade (via TRAF6 and NF-&#954;B) that promotes bone resorption and is also involved in cellular proliferation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy receptor, binding RANKL to inhibit its interaction with RANK and prevent excessive osteoclast activity. Dysregulation of this pathway contributes to tumorigenesis. On the left, OPG binds to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), preventing its interaction with death receptors (DR4 and DR5) on tumor cells. This neutralization inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis, allowing cancer cells to survive.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="cancers-17-00337-g002.jpg"/></fig><fig position="float" id="cancers-17-00337-f003" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Osteoprotegerin (OPG)-mediated mechanisms in cancer progression. OPG enhances proliferation and promotes aneuploidy by activating chromosomal instability pathways involving Aurora A, Bub1, and BubR1 kinases, resulting in genomic disruption. Moreover, OPG drives neoangiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell survival and vascular network formation through paracrine signaling, and facilitating tumor growth and progression, which is further reinforced by OPG&#8217;s ability to stimulate endothelial cell survival and differentiation. Moreover, OPG serves as a decoy receptor for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which prevents apoptosis. OPG also mediates protease activity, including cathepsin D and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), to facilitate cancer invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with OPG (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">rs3102735, rs2073617, rs2073618, rs4845627</italic>) may influence susceptibility to malignancy.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="cancers-17-00337-g003.jpg"/></fig><fig position="float" id="cancers-17-00337-f004" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The role of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in inducing aneuploidy in mammary epithelial cells. A schematic to portray how osteoprotegerin (OPG) leads to chromosomal instability in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). The left panel represents a typical HMEC with a diploid genome and stable chromosomes. The middle panel shows the changes in the chromosomal integrity after the secretion of OPG in the tumor microenvironment. OPG has been shown to upregulate aneuploidy-related kinases such as Aurora A kinase (IAK-1), Bub1 kinase, and BubR1 protein, which disrupt mitotic checkpoint integrity and genomic stability. These regulatory effects underscore OPG&#8217;s contribution to driving aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. The right panel illustrates an aneuploid HMEC with disorganized chromosomes, highlighting the role of OPG in promoting chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, a key feature in cancer progression.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="cancers-17-00337-g004.jpg"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="cancers-17-00337-t001" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">cancers-17-00337-t001_Table 1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>SNPs in the OPG gene and their therapeutic implications.
