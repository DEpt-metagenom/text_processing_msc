Some patients affected by ovarian cancers often present genome instability with one or more of the defects in DNA repair pathways, particularly in homologous recombination (HR), which is strictly linked to mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA 1) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA 2). The treatment of ovarian cancer remains a challenge, and the majority of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancers experience relapse and require additional treatment despite initial therapy, including optimal cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and platinum-based chemotherapy. Targeted therapy at DNA repair genes has become a unique strategy to combat homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) cancers in recent years. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a family of proteins, plays an important role in DNA damage repair, genome stability, and apoptosis of cancer cells, especially in HRD cancers. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been reported to be highly effective and low-toxicity drugs that will tremendously benefit patients with HRD (i.e., BRCA 1/2 mutated) epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) by blocking the DNA repair pathways and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. PARP inhibitors compete with NAD<sup>+</sup> at the catalytic domain (CAT) of PARP to block PARP catalytic activity and the formation of PAR polymers. These effects compromise the cellular ability to overcome DNA SSB damage. The process of HR, an essential error-free pathway to repair DNA DSBs during cell replication, will be blocked in the condition of BRCA 1/2 mutations. The PARP-associated HR pathway can also be partially interrupted by using PARP inhibitors. Grossly, PARP inhibitors have demonstrated some therapeutic benefits in many randomized phase II and III trials when combined with the standard CRS for advanced EOCs. However, similar to other chemotherapy agents, PARP inhibitors have different clinical indications and toxicity profiles and also face drug resistance, which has become a major challenge. In high-grade epithelial ovarian cancers, the cancer cells under hypoxia- or drug-induced stress have the capacity to become polyploidy giant cancer cells (PGCCs), which can survive the attack of chemotherapeutic agents and start endoreplication. These stem-like, self-renewing PGCCs generate mutations to alter the expression/function of kinases, p53, and stem cell markers, and diploid daughter cells can exhibit drug resistance and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. In this review, we discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms of PARP inhibitors and the results from the clinical studies that investigated the effects of the FDA-approved PARP inhibitors olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib. We also review the current research progress on PARP inhibitors, their safety, and their combined usage with antiangiogenic agents. Nevertheless, many unknown aspects of PARP inhibitors, including detailed mechanisms of actions, along with the effectiveness and safety of the treatment of EOCs, warrant further investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>PARP inhibitor</kwd><kwd>olaparib</kwd><kwd>rucaparib</kwd><kwd>niraparib</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Taipei Tzu-Chi Hospital</funding-source><award-id>TCRD-TPE-111-10</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This review and APC were funded by a grant from Taipei Tzu-Chi Hospital, Taiwan (TCRD-TPE-111-10) for K.-H.C.

Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States [<xref rid="B1-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer depend on the specific tumor histopathologic type. Among all types of ovarian cancers, epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC)s comprise the majority (about 95%); the remainders are malignant germ cell and sex cord-stromal cell tumors. The subtypes of EOCs include high-grade serous, low-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous ovarian cancers, in which serous cancer is the most common subtype (75%) [<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The majority of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancers experience relapse and require additional treatment after initial therapy, including an optimal cytoreductive debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy [<xref rid="B3-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because traditional chemotherapies have therapeutic limitations and cumulative toxicities in the treatment of ovarian cancers, other types of therapies are considered second-line treatments for maintenance or prevention. In general, genome instability is a hallmark of ovarian cancer. Some patients affected by ovarian cancers often present genome instability with one or more of the defects in DNA repair pathways, particularly in homologous recombination (HR), which is strictly linked to mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA 1) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA 2) [<xref rid="B4-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An estimated 20% of EOC patients are associated with mutations in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, which relate to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Up to 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) present with HRD [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>DNA damages are frequent during cell life cycles, which result from single-strand break (SSB) or double-strand break (DSB) that can cause genome instability and cell death if not correctly repaired. There are at least five major DNA repair pathways in humans: base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which are active throughout different stages of the cell cycle, allowing the cells to repair the DNA damages. Base excision repair (BER) is responsible for repairing SSBs, while homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are two main pathways in repairing DSBs. The absence, reduction, or dysfunction of proteins involved in these pathways may lead to cellular implications, determining mutagenesis, toxicity, and cell death [<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays a dominant role in DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR). Inhibition of PARPs may cause both SSBR deficiency and HRD in BRCA 1/2-deficient patients, leading to cell death. Based on the molecular mechanisms of actions that target the key points of cancer cells in DNA repair pathways, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) emerge as a new therapeutic approach in the management of EOCs, particularly for HRD (i.e., BRCA 1/2 mutated) ovarian cancers through the mechanism of synthetic lethality [<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By blocking the DNA repair pathways and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, PARPi has been reported to be a highly effective and low-toxicity drug that will tremendously benefit patients with HRD ovarian cancers [<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Currently, three PARP inhibitors olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in EOC patients, though with different clinical indications and toxicity profiles. However, similar to other chemotherapy agents, PARP inhibitors also face drug resistance, which has become a major challenge [<xref rid="B11-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In this review, we discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms of PARP and PARP inhibitors and the results from the clinical studies that investigated the effects of the FDA-approved PARP inhibitors on epithelial ovarian cancers. We also summarize the current research progress on PARP inhibitors, their safety, and their combined usage with antiangiogenic agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-ijms-23-08125"><title>2.

In the second stage, duplicated articles and articles prior to 2005 were excluded after screening. The literature published from 1 January 1992 to 31 March 2022 has been searched to identify eligible articles for review. In the next stage, two experts in the field independently inspected the contents of articles, including demographics, research designs, and outcomes, and identified potentially eligible studies for inclusion. The retrieved articles with poor research designs or mismatched outcomes were excluded at this stage. The discrepancies between the two experts were discussed through their mutual communication to reach a consensus. All eligible articles were included in the review using the searching terms and strategies (database searching, screening, selection, and inclusion of eligible articles).

Molecular Mechanisms of PARP and PARPi Actions</title><sec id="sec3dot1-ijms-23-08125"><title>3.1. The PARP Enzymes</title><p>In terms of genetic repair for DNA damages, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) belong to a family of 17 proteins that play critical roles in different stages of cellular life cycles, including the stress response, chromatin modification, DNA repair, and apoptosis induction (cell death). Among all kinds of PARP, PARP-1 is the most important member due to its role in the DNA repair pathways. <xref rid="ijms-23-08125-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the structure of PARP-1.</p><p>PARP-1 contains three functional domains: a N-terminus DNA-binding domain with zinc finger motifs, a central auto-modification domain that is responsible for releasing the protein from the DNA after catalysis, and a C-terminus catalytic domain (CAT) that houses the protein enzymatic activity and substrate binding sites for nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>). SSBs often occur after oxidative damages, while DSBs often occur during damages that originate from the injuries of chemical or physical agents. The repair of both SSBs and DSBs is closely related to the PARP actions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-ijms-23-08125"><title>3.2. The Mechanism Underlying Single-Strand Break Repair (SSBR) of DNAs</title><p>In the presence of DNA single-strand break (SSB), the DNA-binding domain of PARP binds to the DNA SSB site. Following the activation of NAD<sup>+</sup> on the catalytic domain (CAT), PARP initiates the synthesis of polymeric adenosine diphosphate-ribose (Poly (ADP-ribose) or PAR) chain that plays an essential role in recruiting the repairing enzymes for the DNA repair pathway. The targeted enzymes include DNA ligase III, X-ray cross-complementing gene 1 (XRCC1), and DNA polymerase beta (pol&#946;). After repairing SSB, the PAR chains are degraded via Poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Eventually, PARP and repairing complexes dissociate from the DNA for recycling in the future [<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The Mechanism Underlying Double-Strand Break Repair (DSBR) of DNAs</title><p>On the other hand, PARP can also modulate the pathways of DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) through the recruitment of DSB repair enzymes MRE11 and NBS1, which play key roles in homologous recombination (HR). In addition, PARP also regulates the expression of important HR genes BRCA 1 and RAD51 at a transcription level.</p><p>Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are two main pathways to resolve double-strand breaks (DSBs). HR predominates instead as a mechanism of DNA repair during the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle when a sister chromatid is available to use as a template for in situ repair, in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is a high-fidelity, error-free form of DNA repair mechanism and requires functional BRCA proteins for repairing DSBs. In contrast, NHEJ is active throughout all phases of the cell cycle, and it does not require a homologous template that the DNA is simply trimmed and ligated. Given the lack of a contrast template strand, NHEJ is a faster but error-prone mechanism of DNA repair [<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This error-prone DNA repair often predisposes to genome instability and cell death. <xref rid="ijms-23-08125-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the repairing process of DSBs via the HR and NHEJ pathways.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-ijms-23-08125"><title>3.4. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2</title><p>BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are critical proteins involved in the HR of DSBR [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The MRN complex, composed of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1, plays an important role in response to DNA damage, while the most well-recognized is as a sensor of DSB to initiate HR. The MRN complex recognizes and binds the DSB to facilitate the recruitment and activation of ATM and ATR kinases that phosphorylate downstream targets, including CHEK2, P53, BRCA1, and H2AX. BRCA 1, assisted by BARD1 and BRIP1, has an active role in signaling DNA damage and in cell-cycle checkpoint regulation that organizes the remaining proteins to the site of repair. The MRN complex then initiates the 5&#8242; to 3&#8242; nucleolytic resection of the DNA to form 3&#8242; overhangs of single-stranded DNA that are bound by RPA. With the assistance of PALB2, BRCA 2 recruits and loads an essential recombination enzyme, RAD51, onto RPA-coated DNA. The RAD51 then invades the homologous DNA strand in a process called strand invasion, allowing the remaining DNA repair to occur with the use of the sister chromatid as the template for error-free repair [<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-ijms-23-08125"><title>3.5. PARP Inhibitors: The Mechanisms of Actions</title><p>PARP inhibitors compete with NAD<sup>+</sup> at the catalytic domain (CAT) of PARP to block PARP catalytic activity and the formation of PAR polymers. These effects compromise the cellular ability to overcome DNA SSB damage (<xref rid="ijms-23-08125-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, the unrepaired SSBs can be converted to DSBs through the collapse of the replication fork when PARP is inhibited (PARP trapping mechanism). As previously discussed, homologous recombination (HR) is the essential error-free pathway to repair the DNA of DSBs during cell replication, and it requires functional BRCA 1/2 proteins. The process of HR will be blocked in the condition of BRCA 1/2 mutations. The PARP-associated HR pathway can also be partially interrupted by using PARP inhibitors (<xref rid="ijms-23-08125-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The absence of either a functioning base excision repair (BER) pathway or homologous recombination (i.e., HR deficiency or BRCA 1/2 mutations) has no detrimental impact on cell viability, but the deficiency of both together can lead to synthetically lethal death. Untreated cancer cells without BRCA mutation (HR+, BER+), cancer cells without BRCA mutation treated with a PARP inhibitor (HR+, BER&#8722;), and untreated BRCA-deficient cancer cells (HR&#8722;, BER+) are all viable conditions. However, homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) cancer cells treated with a PARP inhibitor (HR&#8722;, BER&#8722;) are selectively targeted for synthetically lethal cell death as the DNA repair of both SSBs and DSBs relies above all on NHEJ, the error-prone repair pathway [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Therapeutic Effects of PARP Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancers: Clinical Trials</title><p>Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) block the repair of DNA SSBs. For ovarian cancers associated with BRCA mutations or HRD, they result in cell death due to inefficiencies in DNA cell repair mechanisms. PARP inhibitors have been widely studied in the past decade, and the results are highly promising. To date, three PARP inhibitors, namely olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib, have been approved by the FDA for multiple indications in ovarian cancers.

In this study, an oral dose of olaparib 400 mg BID was given as a monotherapy in 298 patients with gBRCAm ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers who had received at least three prior lines of chemotherapy, of whom 193 patients had recurrent ovarian cancers. In patients with gBRCA1/2m recurrent ovarian cancers, 137/193 had measurable diseases at baseline.

A total of 56 patients received oral rucaparib (at doses ranging from 40 to 500 mg QD and 240 to 840 mg BID). No MTD was identified using the protocol-specified criteria, and a dose of 600 mg BID was selected as the RP2D based on manageable toxicity and clinical activity.

The benefit was substantial in the patients with HRD-positive tumors, including those without BRCA mutations. After a median follow-up of 22.9 months, a statistically significant improvement was observed in the median PFS for the patients who received olaparib plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone plus placebo (22.1 months vs. 16.6 months; HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.49&#8211;0.72; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

Results and Discussion</title><p>EOC remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States. The mainstay for the treatment of newly diagnosed EOC is surgical debulking and combined taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy. For patients who have stage II&#8211;IV diseases at presentation, options following surgery and chemotherapy depend on the success of these interventions. These patients should be evaluated with imaging as clinically indicated to determine the extent of residual disease or progression and screen for new metastases. For those who are in complete clinical remission, partial remission, or stable disease, recommended options also depend on the extent of their response and the types of primary chemotherapies they received. All patients with the diagnoses of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers should have a genetic risk evaluation, irrespective of their family history, as the results may impact treatment decisions too. A maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitors can be considered for chemo-sensitive, symptom-free patients if the results of genetic tests are confirmed. Usually, the responses to platinum-based chemotherapy are high, but the vast majority of women will experience a relapse of their cancer following a median PFS of approximately 12 months and require more treatment. In patients with advanced and recurrent ovarian cancers, targeted therapies, including antiangiogenic treatment and PARP inhibitors, have been investigated with the aim of prolonging the PFS and OS.</p><p>PARP inhibitors work based on the concept of synthetic lethality. For ovarian cancers associated with <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations or HRD, the targeted therapy result in cell death due to inefficiencies in DNA cell repair mechanisms. As we have mentioned above, several PARP inhibitors have been shown to be active in recurrent ovarian cancers and have been FDA approved for multiple indications in ovarian cancers. To date, no direct trial comparing the three FDA-approved commercially available PARP inhibitors has been performed. The selection of the PARP inhibitors remains a challenge and depends on personal preference. At the most, the advantage of niraparib usage lies in the benefit for the PFS and OS in the patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancers, irrespective of the HRD status. Grossly, PARP inhibitors have demonstrated some therapeutic benefits in many randomized phase II and III trials when combined with the standard CRS for advanced EOCs. However, there are still some limitations to the usage of PARP inhibitors in clinical practice. Among them, drug resistance is the major obstacle to PARP inhibitors, and further surveys for drug resistance and toxicity are suggested.</p><p>In the current setting, no consensus exists on the protocol to be used. This includes variation in the choice of PARP inhibitors, dosage, length of time, and timing of surgery. Similarly, different results exist in the past studies that investigated the usage of PARP inhibitors for primary or recurrent advanced ovarian cancers. In practice, several discrepancies in results and conclusions among these studies may originate from the clinical setting: the criteria, dosage, and duration of PARP inhibitors.</p><p>In general, all currently available PARP inhibitors have some common adverse events (AEs) that fall into the categories of hematologic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular events, and others, which can compromise the quality of life of patients. In particular, the most common non-hematologic AEs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and fatigue, while hematologic AEs include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and myelosuppression. Across the phase III trials&#8212;the SOLO-1 trial (olaparib monotherapy 300 mg BID vs. placebo), PAOLA-1 trial (olaparib 300 mg BID plus bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab monotherapy), and PRIMA trial (niraparib monotherapy 300 mg QD vs. placebo)&#8212;all PARP inhibitors as an FDA-approved maintenance therapy following the first-line platinum-based therapy have shown higher rates of a number of common non-hematologic AEs, such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue/asthenia that are generally in low-grade and rarely lead to study-drug discontinuation. Similar to bevacizumab, niraparib is associated with a risk of hypertension (&gt;grade 3). Anemia and neutropenia are the most common high-grade hematologic AEs (grade &#8805; 3) for single-agent PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy compared with placebo and are the most common cause of dose discontinuation. Although rare (&#8804;2%), PARP inhibitor therapy is also associated with a risk of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Across all trials, PARP inhibitors are well tolerated, and there are no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in the health-related QOL metrics evaluated [<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Thrombocytopenia is a peculiar hematologic AE in the treatment of niraparib, which has been reported in both the Nova trial and PRIMA trial (both niraparib dosing at 300 mg QD), and the most frequent treatment-related emergency event that requires dose reduction. Two factors have been identified as potential predictors of myelosuppression: baseline platelet count and baseline body weight. Patients who have a baseline platelet count &lt; 150,000/&#956;L and/or body weight &lt; 77 kg when niraparib is started are at a higher risk of grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia and are likely to need subsequent dose reduction. It is recommended that patients who meet either of these criteria should start dosing at 200 mg/daily. Dose escalation may be considered with close monitoring of blood counts if no hematologic events occur within the first 2&#8211;3 months of dosing. The PFS in the patients who are dose-reduced to either 200 or 100 mg is consistent with that of the patients who remain at the 300 mg starting dose. Niraparib also causes hypertension, tachycardia, and headaches due to its inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. The patients affected by hypertension have to monitor their blood pressure regularly and should keep blood pressure maintained below 120/80 mmHg [<xref rid="B39-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Overall, it seems that the PARP inhibitors can extend the life span of patients with epithelial ovarian cancers but cannot eradicate the cancers that have developed after treatment with cisplatin/paclitaxel. Complete surgical removal (cytoreduction) of residual ovarian tumors from the peritoneal cavity seems to be the only successful way to eliminate the tumors, but this is rarely successful due to the difficulty in doing the cytoreductive surgery in the peritoneal space. Moreover, ovarian cancer cells, similar to many other types of cancer cells, have devious mechanisms to evade stress, which is mediated by drugs or hypoxia. In high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC), the cancer cells under stress have the capacity to escape from stress and to become polyploidy giant cancer cells (PGCCs), which eventually release daughter cells that are drug-resistant [<xref rid="B41-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As stem-like, self-renewing cells, the PGCCs can survive the attack of chemotherapeutic agents and start endoreplication, in which process these cells have mutations and subsequently altered expression/function of kinases, p53, and stem cell markers. The generated diploid daughter cells can exhibit drug resistance and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis [<xref rid="B41-ijms-23-08125" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, developing drugs to target PGCCs and endoreplication may be an important approach to reducing the appearance of drug-resistant progeny.</p><p>It remains not fully understood with regard to the molecular and cellular mechanisms of EOCs and their targeted therapies. Further efforts are still required to investigate the therapeutic role of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancers. To minimize the heterogeneity of research in the future, the standardization of several important factors in EOCs and relevant treatment should be considered. Critical factors include the timing, dosage, and duration of PARP inhibitors, all of which have significant impacts on the therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the severity and outcomes in the patients with advanced EOCs also need standardization. Moreover, a larger sample size is required to obtain a reliable conclusion and to improve the reproducibility of the research results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7-ijms-23-08125"><title>7. Conclusions</title><p>The treatment of ovarian cancer remains a challenge, and the majority of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancers experience relapse and require additional treatment despite initial therapy, including an optimal cytoreductive debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Targeted therapy at DNA repair genes has become a unique strategy to combat HRD cancers in recent years. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a family of proteins, plays an important role in DNA damage repair, genome stability, and apoptosis of cancer cells, especially in HRD cancers. PARP inhibitors have been reported to be highly effective and low-toxicity drugs that benefit patients with HRD (i.e., BRCA 1/2 mutated) ovarian cancers by blocking the DNA repair pathways and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells.</p><p>PARP inhibitors compete with NAD<sup>+</sup> at the catalytic domain (CAT) of PARP to block PARP catalytic activity and the formation of PAR polymers. These effects compromise the cellular ability to overcome DNA SSB damage. On the other hand, the unrepaired SSBs can be converted to DSBs through the collapse of the replication fork when PARP is inhibited (PARP trapping mechanism). Homologous recombination (HR) is the essential error-free pathway to repair DNA DSBs during cell replication, and it requires functional BRCA 1/2 proteins. The process of HR will be blocked in the condition of BRCA 1/2 mutations. The PARP-associated HR pathway can also be partially interrupted by using PARP inhibitors.</p><p>At present, three PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib, have been approved by the FDA for clinical use in EOC patients, though with different clinical indications and toxicity profiles. Grossly, PARP inhibitors have demonstrated some therapeutic benefits in many randomized phase II and III trials when combined with the standard CRS for advanced EOCs. This review could help the researchers and healthcare practitioners understand the recent evidence regarding the usage of PARP inhibitors for advanced EOCs, suggestive of future developments in this emerging area. Nevertheless, many unknown aspects of PARP inhibitors, including detailed mechanisms of action, along with the effectiveness and safety for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancers, warrant further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.-H.L., K.-M.S. and K.-H.C. conceived the review and designed the searching methods for the literature; C.-H.L. and K.-H.C. collected the data in the literature; C.-H.L., K.-M.S. and K.-H.C. performed the data analysis; C.-H.L. and K.-H.C. wrote the review.
