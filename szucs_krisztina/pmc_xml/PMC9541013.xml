There is evidence that TIMM8A plays an important role in mitochondrial morphology and fission. Studies have shown that mitophagy and fission could affect the function of immune cells. However, there is currently no research on this gene&#8217;s role in cancer occurrence and progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">TIMM8A expression was analyzed via the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) site and UALCAN database. We evaluated the influence of TIMM8A on clinical prognosis using Kaplan-Meier plotter, the PrognoScan database, and Human Protein Atlas (HPA). The correlations between TIMM8A and cancer immune infiltrates were investigated via TIMER. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) was used to evaluate the potential of tumor immune evasion. Functions of TIMM8A mutations and 50 genes significantly associated with TIMM8A mutations in breast cancer (BRCA) and uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC) were analyzed by GO and KEGG in LinkedOmics database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We investigated the role of TIMM8A in multiple cancers and found that it was significantly associated with poor prognosis in BRCA and UCEC. After analyzing the effect of TIMM8A on immune infiltration, we found Th2 CD4+ T cells might be a common pathway by which TIMM8A contributed to poor prognosis in BRCA and UCEC. Our results suggested that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated M2 macrophages (TAM M2) might be important factors in immune evasion through T cell rejection in both cancers, and considered TIMM8A as a biomarker to predict the efficacy of this therapy in BRCA and UCEC. The results of TIMM8A enrichment analysis showed us that abnormally expressed TIMM8A might affect the mitochondrial protein in BRCA and UCEC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Contributed to illustrating the value of TIMM8A as a prognostic biomarker, our findings suggested that TIMM8A was correlated with prognosis and immune infiltration, including CD8+ T cells, Th2 CD4+ T cells, and macrophages in BRCA and UCEC. In addition, TIMM8A might affect immune infiltration and prognosis in BRCA and UCEC by affecting mitophagy. We believed it could also be a biomarker to predict the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy and proposed to improve the efficacy by eliminating MDSC and TAM M2.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at&#160;10.1186/s12957-022-02736-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>TIMM8A</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Uterine corpus endometrial cancer</kwd><kwd>Anti-PD-L1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Provincial College Students Innovation Training Program of Central South University</institution></funding-source><award-id>S2021105330737</award-id><award-id>S2021105330737</award-id><award-id>S2021105330737</award-id><award-id>S2021105330737</award-id><award-id>S2021105330737</award-id><award-id>S2021105330737</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Changsha Science and Technology Bureau Scientific Research Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>Kq2004155</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par43">BRCA is one of the most common malignant tumors in women, accounting for 31% of systemic malignant tumors in women. Since 2014, the prevalence has slowly increased by about 0.5% per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to statistics, there are about 2,000,000 new breast cancer patients worldwide each year, and an estimated 620,000 patients die from this cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC) is a kind of epithelial malignant tumor that occurs in the endometrium. It is one of the three major malignant tumors of the female reproductive tract, accounting for 7% of female systemic malignant tumors and 20&#8211;30% of female reproductive tract malignant tumors. National statistics show that about 142,000 women worldwide develop endometrial cancer each year, and an estimated 42,000 women die from this cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The pathogenic process of BRCA and UCEC is related to immunity. It is currently believed that the most important feature that BRCA achieve the purpose of immune evasion is the expression of immunosuppressive receptors (such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA)-4, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1, lymphocyte activation genes), infiltration of immunosuppressive factors (such as TGF-&#946; and IL-10), and myeloid-derived immunosuppressive cells (MDSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, Mamessier found that in BRCA, the function of NK cells was altered. This is also an important mechanism of BRCA to achieve immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In UCEC, PD-L1 is present in 70&#8211;80% of malignant endometrial cells, indicating that the PD-1/PD-L pathway may be an important mechanism for immune evasion in UCEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Since immune-related mechanisms play an important role in BRCA, immunotherapy strategies are regarded as novel non-surgical treatments for malignant tumors. The clinical success achieved through the use of blocking antibodies against immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, as well as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, represents the potential of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune checkpoint that binds to PD-1 expressed on the surface of immune effector cells to produce an immunosuppressive effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a role in maintaining peripheral T lymphocyte tolerance and regulating inflammation. In cancer, the expression of PD-L1 is one of the major immune escape mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 with specific antibodies.</p><p id="Par47">However, the current immunotherapy for BRCA and UCEC is unsatisfactory. BRCA had an overall response rate (ORR) of 24% to the PD-L1 antagonist atezolizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Current immunotherapy for UCEC is less effective, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 13% for UCEC to the PD-L1 antagonist avelumab, and a few cases have serious adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, many studies have implied that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TIN) affect the efficacy and prognosis of non-surgical cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, Nakayama proposed the use of phospho-STAT1 (Phospho-STAT1) as a biomarker to predict the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in BRCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In UCEC, research in this area is still relatively blank. If a biomarker can be identified to predict the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in BRCA and UCEC, it will be of great help to clinical research and drug development</p><p id="Par48">First reported in 2003, TIMM8A is a protein-coding gene located on the X chromosome. Tim8a is a member of the intermembrane space chaperone network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]&#160;and functions in a chaperone-like manner with the chaperone protein Tim13 in the complex, to promote entry of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Studies have shown that pathogenic mutations in TIMM8A result in decreased expression of Tim8a, resulting in defects in nuclear-encoded function and mitochondrial morphology and dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Studies on mitochondrial morphological changes have proven that mitochondrial morphological changes lead to the reduction of mitophagy, thus accelerating the apoptosis of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on previous findings, we speculated that abnormal expression of TIMM8A in cancer might also affect the function of immune cells by affecting mitochondria, thereby affecting the development and prognosis of cancer. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the impact of TIMM8A in BRCA and UCEC on multiple immune cells and mitochondria-related pathways and analyzed its potential as a biomarker.</p><p id="Par49">In this study, for the first time, we comprehensively analyzed the expression of TIMM8A and its association with the prognosis of cancer patients using databases such as Ualcan, PrognoScan, Human Protein Atlas, and Kaplan-Meier plotter. In addition, we investigated the association of TIMM8A with tumor-infiltrating immune cells in BRCA and UCEC through the Tumor Immunity Estimation Resource (TIMER) and TIDE databases. The findings in this report elucidate the important role of TIMM8A in BRCA and UCEC, provide potential relationships and underlying mechanisms between TIMM8A and tumor-immune interactions, and provide insights into the use of anti-PD-L1 therapy in BRCA and UCEC. Outcomes in BRCA and UCEC were predicted and recommendations for improvement were made. Finally, we analyzed the functions and pathways of TIMM8A mutation and its 50 frequently altered neighboring genes in BRCA and UCEC patients to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of TIMM8A in the pathogenesis or the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TIMER database analysis</title><p id="Par50">TIMER is a database systematically analyzing different types of tumors (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://timer.comp-genomics.org/">http://timer.comp-genomics.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which provides immune infiltrates&#8217; abundances estimated by multiple immune deconvolution methods.

In hepatocellular carcinoma, the efficacy of the PD-L1 monoclonal antibody Atezolizumab reached 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, in BRCA, immunotherapy by anti-PD-L1 was less than 24% effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Changes in its expression can lead to significant changes in mitochondrial morphology affecting mitophagy. Since mitophagy played an important role in decreasing immune cell apoptosis as well as tumorigenesis, we speculated that TIMM8A might affect the prognosis and lymphocyte infiltration levels in BRCA and UCEC. Perhaps it could serve as a biomarker for prognosis and predicting the efficacy of anti PD-L1 which is associated with T lymphocyte infiltration.</p><p id="Par71">In this study, we observed a statistically significant difference in the expression levels of TIMM8A between 15 cancers and corresponding normal tissues using the RNA-seq data of various malignant tumors in the TIMER database. After evaluating the effect of TIMM8A on the survival of 15 cancers using the Kaplan-Meier plotter, we found that the highly expressed TIMM8A had the most significant effect on the survival of BRCA and UCEC, and with the PrognoScan database we reconfirmed that the highly expressed TIMM8A had the most significant adverse effect on the RFS and DMFS of BRCA. The results in the Human Protein Atlas also confirmed the adverse effect of high expression of TIMM8A on the survival rate of UCEC.</p><p id="Par72">Subsequently, we retrieved the expression levels of TIMM8A in different stages of BRCA and UCEC in the Ualcan database. The results showed that in BRCA, except for stage 3, the TIMM8A expression in the other stages was increased as the increase of the stage. While in UCEC, the expression of TIMM8A increased following the cancer stages. This finding suggested that TIMM8A might be used as a prognostic biomarker in BRCA and UCEC.</p><p id="Par73">TIMM8A is closely related to mitochondria which are involved in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. Xu has found that immune cells such as NK cells can resist apoptosis through mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Suspecting that TIMM8A might affect immune infiltration by affecting mitophagy, we explored the relationship between TIMM8A and mitophagy. The PINK1/PARKIN pathway plays an important role in mitophagy. We found that in BRCA, the expression of TIMM8A was negatively correlated with PINK1 and Parkin. In UCEC, Parkin was found to be negatively correlated with TIMM8A which was not significantly correlated with PINK1. The PINK1/Parkin pathway can selectively degrade mitochondria and play an important role in the activation of mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Downregulation of these two proteins can inhibit mitophagy. Since mitophagy is an anti-apoptotic pathway of immune cells, it might affect immune infiltration and prognosis in addition, when mitophagy is inhibited in tumors, the proportion of dysfunctional mitochondria in tumors increases, which reduces mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation increasing ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Glycolysis was also upgraduated and thus might contribute to the Warburg effect promoting tumorigenesis. This suggested that in both BRCA and UCEC, mitophagy might be inhibited due to the increased expression of TIMM8A, which promoted immune cell apoptosis and tumorigenesis. It might also account for the fact that TIMM8A had a strong negative correlation with NK cell infiltration in UCEC but not in BRCA.</p><p id="Par74">The correlation between TIMM8A and various immune cell infiltration in BRCA and UCEC was verified by Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, especially the high positive correlation between Th2 CD4+ T cells and TIMM8A.

CD8+ T cells play an extremely important specific immune role in the process of fighting tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Th2 CD4+ T cells can indirectly suppress cellular immunity by inhibiting the proliferation of Th1 CD4+ T cells. The results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>&#160;showed that TIMM8A was significantly positively associated with Th2 CD4+ T cells in both cancers, which might also affect the level of CD8+ T cell infiltration.

In BRCA, the TIMM8A level was positively correlated with IL-1A which could help increase the number of CD8+ T cells. However, in UCEC, the level of TIMM8A was negatively correlated with IL-2. In addition, the positive correlation of CD80 and CD86 with TIMM8A in BRCA was stronger than that in UCEC.

Since TIMM8A was highly expressed in BRCA, it might be a good indicator of immune response to anti-PD-L1 therapy in BRCA.

The TIMM8A mutation in BRCA significantly regulates molecular functions such as 0ncRNA processing, cell components such as mitochondrial protein complexes, ribosomal structure and composition, and ribosomal pathway. Meanwhile, our results showed that protein translation was significantly related to TIMM8A mutation. TIMM8A mutation in UCEC has significant regulation on chromosome separation, cell components such as chromosome region, molecular function such as ribosomal structure composition, cell cycle, and other pathways. In general, TIMM8A is closely related to mitochondrial composition and function in BRCA and UCEC. It is speculated that TIMM8A may affect the process and prognosis of BRCA and UCEC by affecting mitochondrial function. Previous research has established that the proportion of TIMM8A mutation in the population with auditory neuropathy was 1.8 %, and the deafness-myotension disorder-optic neuropathy (DDON) syndrome was caused by the unassembled DDP1/TIMM8a-TIMM13 complex in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, in DDON, there are about 15 pathogenic variants in TIMM8A, which will lead to the replacement of methionine required to start protein translation, resulting in the complete deletion of Tim8a/DDP protein and affecting the function of neurons in specific neuronal groups. This is consistent with the enrichment analysis that TIMM8A has a certain effect on mitochondrial protein complexes. Most importantly, the C-terminal portion of Tim8a interacts with the dynamic-related protein 1 (DRP1) during mitochondrial programmed cell death (PCD), which is characterized by extensive mitochondrial fragmentation during PCD. This is achieved by DRP1 interacting with Tim8 a to locate the mitochondria and increase their fission rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It indicates that TIMM8A can increase the mitochondrial fission rate. Zhang found that the expression of DRP1 protein was generally increased in BRCA, and the increased amount was directly proportional to the invasiveness and metastasis of BRCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. And mitochondrial fission was enhanced in metastatic BRCA. Cormio et al. found that in UCEC, increased mitochondrial biosynthesis required for mitochondrial fission was considered a potential biomarker for determining the risk of malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Zheng et al. found that mitochondrial fragmentation reduced the number of NK cell recapitulation and two major subpopulations of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment, and weakened their antitumor ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Tim8a can enhance the efficiency of mitochondrial fission and the degree of mitochondrial fragmentation by binding to DRP1. This indicated that TIMM8A might have the same pathogenic pathway in DDON, auditory neuropathy, BRCA, and UCEC. That was, they all affected the disease by affecting mitochondrial function and fission.</p><p id="Par79">Previous studies of TIMM8A have been limited to neurodegeneration and deafness-dystonia-optic neuron disease syndromes, with a lack of articles in oncology. This study illustrated that TIMM8A was abnormally expressed in a variety of malignant tumors, and significantly affected the prognosis of BRCA and UCEC for the first time. We further explored the effect of TIMM8A on the level of immune infiltration in BRCA and UCEC and preliminarily speculated that TIMM8A affected immune infiltration in BRCA and UCEC by affecting mitophagy, thereby leading to the poor prognosis of these two cancers. In addition, this study predicted the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy against BRCA and UCEC and made recommendations to improve efficacy by eliminating MDSCs and TAM M2. There exists scope for improvement in this study. The effect of TIMM8A on DMFS and RFS of UCEC still needs further exploration. The relationship with other immune-related cytokines is also not fully explored. In future research, we plan to overexpress or knock-down TIMM8A in T cells, NK cells, MDSC, and TAM M2, then evaluate the changes in immune function of these cells with in vivo and in vitro experiments, in order to study the impact of TIMM8A on the progression and treatment of BRCA and UCEC more precisely and accurately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par80">Taken together, for the first time, our pan-cancer analyses of TIMM8A indicated statistical correlations of TIMM8A expression with clinical prognosis in BRCA and UCEC. And found that the expression of TIMM8A in BRCA and UCEC substantially increased following the cancer stages, which contributed to illustrate the value of TIMM8A as a prognostic biomarker in BRCA and UCEC. Furthermore, we speculated on the possible mechanism by which TIMM8A affected immune infiltration and prognosis in BRCA and UCEC by affecting mitophagy, providing inspiration for futural drug development. In addition, we predicted the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in BRCA and UCEC. We believed that TIMM8A could serve as a biomarker predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. TIMM8A predicts good efficacy in BRCA but not in UCEC. We proposed to improve the efficacy by eliminating MDSC and TAM M2, which would contribute to the development of clinical research in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
