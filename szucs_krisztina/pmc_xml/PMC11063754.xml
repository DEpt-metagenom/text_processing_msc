Autophagy plays a crucial role in cancer progression, however, the function of autophagy-related gene neuroregulatory protein 2 (NRG2) in BRCA and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the expression of the NRG2 gene in BRCA was significantly down-regulated compared with the normal controls. The low expression level of NRG2 was related to poor survival rate of BRCA. The receiver operating characteristic curve of NRG2 showed a good diagnostic value for distinguishing BRCA from normal tissues (AUC=0.932). GO-KEGG analysis and GSEA enrichment analysis showed that NRG2 and its regulated genes were enriched in autophagy-related and immune-related pathways, and NRG2 was positively correlated with a number of immune cells and immune checkpoint genes. In addition, knockdown of NRG2 significantly promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of BRCA cells. The autophagy marker, LC3-II and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, vimentin were increased, while P62 and E-cadherin were decreased in response to NRG2 depletion. The findings of the present study demonstrated that NRG2 acts as a tumor suppressor factor that contributes to the immune escape and anti-tumor immunity inhibition by regulating the pathological process of autophagy and EMT, suggesting that NRG2 could be used as a prognostic biomarker and clinical target for BRCA therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neuroregulatory protein 2</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>epithelial-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Foundation of Hubei Province Supporting Enterprise Technology Innovation Development</funding-source><award-id>2021BAB126</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Wuhan East Lake High-tech Zone &#8216;JieBangGuaShuai&#8217; Project</funding-source><award-id>2022KJB113</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Foundation of Wuhan University of Science and Technology</funding-source><award-id>2016&#215;z036</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Foundation of Hubei Province Supporting Enterprise Technology Innovation Development (grant no. 2021BAB126), Wuhan East Lake High-tech Zone &#8216;JieBangGuaShuai&#8217; Project (grant no. 2022KJB113) and Foundation of Wuhan University of Science and Technology (grant no. 2016&#215;z036).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer (BRCA) has become the most prevalent cancer in women, with ~20,000 new cases reported each year, making it the primary cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide (<xref rid="b1-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b3-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Based on the International Agency for Research on Cancer reports, BRCA has accounted for 31% of all malignancies in women by 2023 (<xref rid="b4-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The available clinical strategies for the treatment of BRCA include surgical excision, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy, however, due to residual tumors and drug resistance, patients with BRCA still generally have a poor prognosis and the rate of relapse remains high (<xref rid="b5-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to explore the molecular mechanisms of BRCA development to identify significantly effective therapeutic targets and prognostic indicators.</p><p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular, degrative process that is activated in response to various stressors and regulated by evolutionarily conserved autophagy-related genes (ATGs) (<xref rid="b6-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).

Previous studies reported that autophagy plays a dual role in cancer development whereby it can inhibit metastasis in the early stage of tumorigenesis, while promoting tumor progression by increasing cell growth, proliferation and survival in the late stage (<xref rid="b6-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

Considering the important role of autophagy in BRCA, an autophagy-related prognosis model of BRCA in TCGA dataset was constructed, and it was found that NRG2 served as a hub gene through the PPI network of DEATGs.</p><p>In the present study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the potential regulatory pathways and biological functions of NRG2 in BRCA. Additionally, the effect of NRG2 on the malignant characteristics of BRCA was verified by experiments. According to the findings, NRG2 was significantly under-expressed in patients with BRCA and may change during the early stages of BRCA. Survival analysis results revealed that the OS, PFI and DSS rate of patients with high NRG2 expression was significantly greater than that of low levels. The ROC curve indicated that low NRG2 expression has a good diagnostic value. Finally, the results of the multiple Cox regression analyses showed that low NRG2 expression is an independent risk factor for OS. The aforementioned findings indicated that NRG2 may serve as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for BRCA.

GO-KEGG analysis also showed that the NRG2 related genes were enriched in regulation of T cell activation and chemokine activity. The TISIDB demonstrated that NRG2 might positively regulate the CX3CL1 and CXCL family especially CXCL1-6. The main function of CXCL1-6 is recruitment of immunocytes, especially neutrophils (<xref rid="b41-ol-27-6-14410" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The decrease of recruitment of immunocytes induced by NRG2 knockdown in BRCA also reduced immune infiltration level.

Both the processes of autophagy and EMT are crucially involved in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.

Furthermore, although the present study proved that NRG2 can promote autophagy and EMT in BRCA through bioinformatics combined with experiments, its exact mechanism and its role in other cell lines needs to be investigated in further studies.</p><p>In summary, the present study found that NRG2 is an autophagy-related prognostic biomarker, which is significantly associated with an improved prognosis. Downregulation of NRG2 may be strongly associated with oncogenic processes involving the inhibition of anti-tumor immunity and enhancement of immune evasion. The NRG2 gene may act as a tumor suppressor factor that inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration by regulating the pathological process of autophagy and EMT, suggesting that NRG2 could be used as a prognostic marker for clinical therapy of BRCA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-ol-27-6-14410" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="Supplementary_Data1.pdf" id="d66e609" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2-ol-27-6-14410" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="Supplementary_Data2.pdf" id="d66e613" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Yuan Cao at The Medicine &amp; Sciences Analysis Center of Wuhan University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China) for their help with immunofluorescence imaging and analysis.
